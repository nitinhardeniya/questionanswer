==============

a basic question answering system

1. Please use git clone https://github.com/nitinhardeniya/questionanswer.git to get the latest copy.
2. you need to run python file questionanswer.py <intextfile> <question>
3. you might get some warning and logs please ignore them


The only this we need to make sure is we need to provide a xml instead of .txt you can just add a dummy <root>doc<\root> as in example test.xml
