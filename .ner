Usage: annotate_timex [options] FILENAME

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c DCT, --dct=DCT     The document creation time used as the basis for
                        normalisation. If not set, it will attempt to be
                        extracted from the document.

  Format Options:
    Options for dealing with the type of input and output files

    -t DOC_TYPE, --doctype=DOC_TYPE
                        The format of the document and resulting tags.
                        Supported values: timex2 - XML document resulting in
                        TIMEX2 tags; timex3 - XML document resulting in TIMEX3
                        tags; tern - a document from the TERN corpus; timeml -
                        a document annotated with TimeML
    -s, --strip-timexes
                        If set, any timexes in the document are stripped, and
                        then tagging starts afresh. If you don't enable this,
                        feed in a document which already has TIMEXes in it and
                        are doing recognition, you may end up with duplicate
                        TIMEX tags.
    -b BODY_TAG, --body-tag=BODY_TAG
                        If set, this tag only the contents of this tag is
                        tagged.
    --s-tag=S_tag       If set, this tag name is used to denote sentence
                        boundaries. If unset, NLTK is used to tokenise.
    --lex-tag=LEX_tag   If set, this tag name is used to denote token
                        boundaries. If unset, NLTK is used to tokenise.
    --pos-attr=POS_attr
                        If set, then this attribute on the tag set by --lex-
                        tag is used to denote the POS tag of that token. If
                        unset, NLTK is used for POS tagging.

  Recognition Rules:
    -r RECOGNITION_ENGINE, --recognition-engine=RECOGNITION_ENGINE
                        Selects the engine to use for TIMEX recognition.
                        Defaults to the currently recommended TERNIP engine.
                        Other options are 'rule' for the rule engine and
                        'none' to disable recognition (e.g., if the document
                        already has TIMEXs annotated, but just needs
                        normalising)
    --recognition-rules=RECOGNITION_RULES
                        Path to recognition rules. Defaults to
                        ./rules/recognition/

  Normalisation Rules:
    -n NORMALISATION_ENGINE, --normalisation-engine=NORMALISATION_ENGINE
                        Selects the engine to use for TIMEX recognition.
                        Defaults to the currently recommended TERNIP engine.
                        Other options are 'rule' for the rule engine and
                        'none' to disable recognition (e.g., to just do
                        recognition)
    --normalisation-rules=NORMALISATION_RULES
                        Path to normalisation rules. Defaults to
                        ./rules/normalisation/
