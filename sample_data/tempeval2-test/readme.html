<p>In this document, we describe the Tempeval test data. The description focuses on
the English data, but the format for all other languages, with the exception of the French
data, is essentially the same.</p>

<p>The unavoidable updates to this document will be published on the Tempeval2 pages
at <a
href="http://www.timeml.org/tempeval2/">http://www.timeml.org/tempeval2/</a>,
which also contains a link to the Tempeval Google group.</p>

<h3>Data description</h3>

<p>The data format is the same as for the training data, consult the release notes with the
training data for details. However, depending on the task some data will be left
out:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr valign="top">
  <td>Tasks A and B</td>
  <td>Only the file "base-segmentation.tab" will be provided. The task would be to create
  the files "timex-extents.tab", "timex-attributes.tab", "event-extents.tab", and
  "event-attributes.tab". The format of those files should identical to the same files in
  the training data. But note that the scorer script only uses the first three columns for
  the extent data and the first three and ther last two columns for the attribute
  data.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td>Tasks&nbsp;C&nbsp;through&nbsp;F</td>
  <td>All files will be provided, but the relation types in the files with temporal links
  will be set to "NONE". The task here is to replace "NONE" with one of the acceptable
  relation types. Teams are allowed to leave "NONE" as the value, in which case those
  relations will be skipped by the scorer, there will however be an accompanying note
  with the score that makes explicit how many relations were not generated (a recall score
  basically).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Language-specific remarks</h3>

<p>The French data are not provided as vertical files, but as XML files. Special
release notes for French will also be posted on the Tempeval Google group.</p>

<p>With the exception of French and Italian, the Document Creation Time is given as a
separate file in the release. For French, the DCT is given as a timex inside the XML
document where the attribute functionInDocument has value PUBLICATION_TIME, in most cases,
the DCT is also reflected in the file name. For Italian, the DCT is typically given as the
first timex in each document, marked with t1. There are a couple of exceptions though:</p>

<ul>
<li>cs.morph015 and cs.morph016 have as DCT 1995-08-07T18:00; signaled by t0
<li>els.morph041 has as DCT 1986-09-30T18:00; signaled by t0
<li>els.morph042 has as DCT 1986-09-29T18:00; signaled by t0
</ul>
