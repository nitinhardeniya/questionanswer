<h2>Basic definitions</h2>

<p>We consider main events within the scope of a sentence. With that
       in mind, we start by defining the basic notions at
       play: <i>sentence</i>, and <i>event</i>.</p>

<h3>Sentence</h3>

<p>We adopt the notion of <i>sentence</i> standardly assume in the NLP
community. That is, as the basic textual unit immediately above the
phrase which ends with a terminal punctuation mark, such
as: <b>.</b>, <b>?</b>, or <b>!</b>. Example (1) contains two
different sentences (delimited by the &lt;s&gt; tag), whereas example (2) has
only one.

<blockquote>
  	<p>(1) &lt;s&gt;Australia has been independent since
	1901.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;However, it still recognizes the
	British monarch as its head of state.&lt;/s&gt;
  	<p>(2) &lt;s&gt;Australia has been independent since
	1901, but it still recognizes the
	British monarch as its head of state.&lt;/s&gt;          
  </blockquote>

<h3>Event</h3>

<p> <i>Event</i> is a cover term for predicates describing:
  <ul>
    <li>Situations that <i>happen</i> or <i>occur</i>. <!--They can be
    punctual (as the expression underlined in 3) or last for a
    period of time (4).-->

    <blockquote>
	<!--<p>(3) Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer, first
          <u>reached</u> the islands in search of spices.</p>-->
	<p>(3) 11,024 people were <u>evacuated</u> to 18 disaster
      	relief centers.</p>
	</blockquote>
    </li>

    <li><i>States</i> or <i>circumstances</i> in which something
obtains or holds true (4).

	<blockquote>
    	<p>(4) After these payments, about $225,000 will
 	be <u>available</u> for the 20 million common
 	shares <u>outstanding</u>.
	</blockquote>
     </li>
     </ul>	

<p>Events can be denoted by verbs (<i>reach, evacuate</i>), 
  adjectives (<i>available, outstanding</i>), or nouns (<i>search,
  payment</i>).</p>  

<p>Events in text are annotated following TimeML annotation
  guidelines (Saur&iacute; et al., 2005:section 2.1.1). These
  guidelines cover problematic cases in detail, such as: light verb
  constructions, complex verb forms (with auxiliaries and/or polarity
  particles), phrasal verbs, predicative constructions, etc.

<h2>Identifying main events</h2>

<p>There will be only one main event per sentence.

<p>Identifying the main event in a sentence that has only one event is
  trivial, since this automatically becomes the main event of that
  sentence.
  
<p>In the case of sentences with multiple events (e.g.,
  example 5), the main event will be determined following very
  shallow, syntactic-based criteria.

<blockquote>
    <p>(5) ``We're <u>expecting</u> a major <u>eruption</u>,''
he <u>said</u> in a telephone <u>interview</u> early today.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>Two different situations can be distinguished here:

<h3>Subordination contexts</h3>

<!--<p>Two events are in a subordination relation if one is the matrix
  predicate of the sentence main clause, and the other is the matrix
  predicate of a subordinated clause or phrase.-->
  
<p>The <b>main event</b> will be the event that is dominant
  syntactically. This apply to all kinds of subordination. Here, we list
  the most relevant for reference. 

  <ol>
    <li><b><i>that</i>-clauses:</b> They are introduced by the
     conjunction <i>that</i>, although in some cases this can be
     omitted. Grammatically, they can function in different roles,
     such as subject (6) or object (7) of certain verbs. In the
     following examples, the two relevant events are in bold face,
     with the main one underlined.
<blockquote>
          <p>(6) It <b><u>surprised</u></b>
        me [that Gulshan Lake <b>has</b> so many little bugs and
        bacteria].
        <p>(7) He <b><u>told</u></b>
        reporters [(that) he <b>had</b> no message from Baghdad].
  </blockquote>
    
    </li>
    <li><b><i>if-</i> and <i>wh-</i>clauses:</b> Introduced
    by the cojunctions <i>if</i> and <i>whether</i> (8), or by a <i>wh</i>
    particle (<i>who, where, what, how</i>, etc.) (9). Grammatically,
    they can function as object or subject of a verb as well.

      <blockquote>
	<p>(8) Reporters <b><u>asked</u></b> President Bush [whether the interdiction would <b>apply</b> to food].
	<p>(9) The panel is <b><u>investigating</u></b> [who <b>shot</b> down Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane on April 6, 1994]. 
  </blockquote>
      
    </li>
    <li><b>Relative clauses:</b> They are noun modifiers. In case that
    the noun head denotes an event and is not subordinated to any other
    event in the sentence, this noun will be the main
    event. <!--Situations like this are however rare.-->

      <blockquote>
        <p>(10) A <b><u>war</u></b> [that is <b>supposed</b> to help feed the
        desperate people of Afghanistan].
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><b>Small clauses:</b> They are minimal predicate structures
    with no tense. We are also including here <i>ing-</i>clauses (13).
      <blockquote>
        <p>(11) Several neighbors <b><u>heard</u></b> [it <b>happen</b>].
          <p>(12) Her wife <b><u>convinced</u></b> [him to <b>leave</b>
          the country].
          <p>(13) I don't <b><u>see</u></b> things [<b>getting</b> as acrimonious as they do].
        </blockquote>
      
     <li><b>Adverbial clauses:</b> Introduced by subordinating
    conjunctions expressing: temporal relations (<i>after, before,
    when, while</i>), purpose (<i>to, in order to, so that</i>), cause
    (<i>because, since</i>), condition (<i>if, unless</i>), or
    contrast (<i>although, even though, while</i>), comparison
    (<i>similar to, like</i>). Note that none of
    these lists are necessarily exhaustive.
      <blockquote>
	<p>(14) He <b><u>stayed</u></b> behind because he
	couldn't <b>speak</b> French.
	<p>(15) So when Wong Kwan <b>spent</b> seventy million dollars for this house, he <b><u>thought</u></b> it was a great deal.        
        </blockquote>
      
    </li>
    <li><b>Comparative clauses:</b> The subordinated clause is
    introduced by conjunctions <i>as</i> or <i>than</i>.
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>(16) There have been far more <b><u>participants</u></b>
        this year [than there <b>were</b> last year].
        <p>(17) He is about as <b><u>old</u></b> [as his
        father <b>was</b> at his age]. 
        </blockquote>
  
	<p>Two comments need to be made here. First, note that the
      main events selected here (<i>participants, old</i>) do not
      denote an event by themselves. They are however annotated as
      events following the TimeML annotation guidelines (Saur&iacute;
      et al, 2005), which specify that the copular verb <i>be</i> is
      never marked as event, but the head of their predicative
      complement instead.
	<p>Second, in (17) there are two phrases introduced by the
	conjunction <i>as</i>. The subordinated phrase is the
	second one.
      
    </li>
    <li><b>NPs, APs, or PPs headed by an event-denoting element:</b>
    They can function as subjects, objects, or other arguments of verbal
    predicates (18-19). They can also be complements of nouns (20) or
    adjectives (21).
      <blockquote>
        <p>(18)[The <b>transaction</b>] has
        been <b><u>approved</u></b> by Kyle's board.
        <p>(19) The new Essex County task force
        is <b><u>delving</u></b> [into the <b>slayings</b> of 14 black
        women].
        <p>(20) There was no independent <b><u>confirmation</u></b> [of
        the <b>fact</b>] by the government-run news agency.
        <p>(21) The agreement is <b><u>subject</u></b> [to shareholder and regulatory <b>approval</b>].  
        </blockquote>
      
    </li>
      </ol>
  
<h4>Controversial cases</h4>  

<ul>
<li>In constructions involving <b>aspectual predicates</b> (22) and <b>light
  verbs</b> (23), the syntacticaclly dominant element is semantically
  weaker than the subordinated event. We will however annotate the syntactic
  head as main event, following the general rule set above for
  contexts of subordination, since the semantic head can be easily
  recovered by the syntax, as well as any temporal relation that may
  hold between the main event and the subordinated one.

  <blockquote>
    <p>(22) A new Essex County task
        force <b><u>began</u></b> [<b>delving</b> Thursday into the
        slayings of 14 black women].
      <p>(23) The chip <b><u>gives</u></b> [wrong <b>answers</b>] for some mathematical calculations.
    </blockquote>
  
<li>In news reports, <b>reporting</b> and <b>perception events</b>
  seem pragmatically less relevant than the events being reported or
  perceived --that is, the events denoted by the subordinated
  complements. Nonetheless, the same general criterion for
  subordination relations will be applied here, and we will therefore
  annotate the reporting or perception event as the main event of the
  sentence. Similar to ligth verbs and aspectual predications, the
  semantic relations holding between the two events can be generally
  calculated from the syntactic structure.
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>(24) [But over all, arrests were <b>made</b> in more than
    60 percent of murder cases], he <b><u>said</u></b>.</p>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Causal sentences</b> are difficult to annotate from a semantic
  perspective. What is the main event in the sentence (25),
  where <i>rains</i>, <i>caused</i>, and <i>flooding</i> are all
  event-denoting expressions? Deciding among one or another element
  may be an arbitrary decision. Thus, causal sentences will follow the
  same syntactic-based rule presented above: the main event will be
  the syntactic head.
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>(25) The <b>rains</b> <b><u>caused</u></b> the <b>flood</b>.
    </blockquote>
  
</ul>

  
<h3>Coordination contexts</h3>

<p>The <b>main event</b> will be the first one of the two coordinated
  events. Some coordinating conjunctions in English are: <i>and, or,
  but, nor, yet, so, as well as, only, such that</i>.

<blockquote>
    <p>(26) He <b><u>sold</u></b> the property to five buyers [and] <b>said</b> he'd double his money.</p>
    <p>(27) Australia has been <b><u>independent</u></b> since 1901,
    [but] like many Commonwealth nations it still <b>recognizes</b>
    the British monarch as its head of state.</p>
    <p>(28) I had <b><u>hoped</u></b> to see her, [only] she did
    not <b>come</b>.</p>
    <p>(29) The work started very <b><u>hard</u></b>, [such that] many
    people were <b>injured</b>.

</blockquote>

<h2>Guidelines basic scheme</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Annotate only one main event per sentence.</li>
  <li>In subordination relations, the main event is the dominant
  syntactically.</li>
  <li>In coordination relations, the main event is the first one in the
  sentence string.</li>
    </ol>
