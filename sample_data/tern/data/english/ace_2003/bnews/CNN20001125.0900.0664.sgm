 the russian government wants to take control of one of its most valuable
 exports.
 the government reportedly plans to make caviar production a state monopoly.
 one official says the move would end sturgeon-poaching, which has devastated
 the fish population, and increase government revenue.
 the country officially exported $25 million worth of caviar last year, while
 poachers' exports were estimated at $250 million.
