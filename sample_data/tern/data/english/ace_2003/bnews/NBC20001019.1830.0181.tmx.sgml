 terrorism is such a threat to the united states, and it
 knows no boundaries, so the role of the fbi has expanded
 worldwide. the director of the fbi,
 louis freeh, has gone to yemen to personally
 supervise the investigation. and nbc's pete williams has
 the latest.

 the fbi director arrives in yemen to find
 an investigation surprisingly well advanced, thanks in lar
 part, he says, to aggressive work by local police.
<TURN>
 i complimented the president and the yemeni authorities
 for the very good investigative work they have done,
 particularly in finding those locations which we feel may be
 relevant to the case.

 in  fact
 ,  fbi
 agents are checking out a chain of
 discoveries that begin shortly after an explosion.
 a <TIMEX2 val="P12Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">12-year-old</TIMEX2> boy reports seeing a man launch a rubber boat
 from a car parked at the harbor. fbi officials find what they
 believe may be explosives in the car.
 yemeni police trace the car to a nearby house.
 the fbi finds traces of explosives on clothes found
 neighbors say they saw two men who they describe
 as "arab-looking" living there for <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W46" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">several weeks</TIMEX2>.
 police also find a second house where authorities believe two
 others may  have assembled
 the bomb, possibly doing some welding.
 passports found in one of the houses identify the men
 as from a privilege convenience province
 noted for lawless tribes.
 but the documents turn out to be fakes.
 meantime, analysts at the fbi crime lab try to discover what
 the bomb was made from. no conclusions yet,
 u.s. officials say. but a working theory, plastic
 explosive. but yemen's president says
 the fbi has told him the explosive material could
 only have come from the u.s., israel or two arab countries.
 and to a former federal bomb investigator, that description
 suggests a powerful military-style plastic explosive
 c-4 that can be cut or molded into different shapes.
<TURN>
 it is a very powerful explosive, one of the most
 powerful explosives found in bulk, demolition bulks, for
 example.

 of who ordered the bombing -- one that yemen's president
 calls, "an octopus of an operation, planned
