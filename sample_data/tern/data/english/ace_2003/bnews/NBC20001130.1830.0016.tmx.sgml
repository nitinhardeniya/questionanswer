 <TIMEX2 val="TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">good evening</TIMEX2>.
 it's been <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day of filings with the u.s. supreme court, more arguments for the
 florida supreme court, pilgrimages to governor bush's ranch in texas and
 televised truck rides</TIMEX2>.
 all of this against a calendar leading to <TIMEX2 val="2000-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">december</TIMEX2> and the selection of
 florida's presidential electors.
 and all of this on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the eve of the most widely anticipated supreme court hearing
 since watergate</TIMEX2>.
 more than 460,000 ballots n from palm beach county packed in a ryder truck,
 driven to the state capitol in tallahassee.
 both sides filing papers with u.s. supreme court, preparing for <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2>'s
 historic arguments.
 george w. bush speaking for the first time in <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">several days</TIMEX2>, calling for the
 need to settle this once and for all.
 and <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a wild day on wall street</TIMEX2>, with the dow falling over 214 points.
 nbc's david bloom is in florida <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> and david gregory outside governor
 bush's ranch in texas.
 n david bloom, let's begin with you.
<TURN>
 tom, so many moving pieces, but <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> perhaps none more important than this
 -- with the blessing of texas governor george w. bush and florida governor jeb
 bush t state legislature here in tallahassee is moving rapidly to try to take
 control of this election away from the courts.
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, even as the 462,000 ballots from palm beach county arrive amid much
 hoopla in tallahassee, it is the republican-controlled florida legislature that
 takes n center stage.
 lawmakers voting to meet <TIMEX2 val="2000-W49" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next week</TIMEX2> in special session to award florida's 25
 electoral votes to george w. bush.
 prominent democrats led by joseph lieberman <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> accusing bush's brother,
 florida governor jeb bush, of making a "end run" around the courts.
<TURN>
 it threatens to put us into a constitutional crisis, which we are not in <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-30T18:30:16.81" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> by
 any stretch of the word n and i just want to appeal to governor jeb bush and
 the members of the florida legislature to reconsider this action.
<TURN>
 but dropping any pretense of neutrality, both bush brothers make clear <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> if
 the courts don't quickly resolve this disputed presidential election the
 florida legislature will.
<TURN>
 all options are on the table.
 but one of our strategies is to get this election ratified.
 and the sooner the better for the good of the country.
<TURN>
 i know that the gore campaign n would love for me to basically disown my
 family, but look, i'm going to do what's right.
<TURN>
 in appealing this case <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> the florida supreme courts vice president gore
 argues that only 14,000 ballots are in dispute.
 that governor bush's demand to review as many as 1.1 million ballots is
 "nothing less than a transparent and deceptive attempt to further delay these
 proceedings."
 gore maintains those 14,000 ballots will n show real votes missed by the
 counting machines if only someone looks at them.
 and wants the state's high court to order a hand recount <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-30T18:30:16.81" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 we're going to try to get as many of those votes counted as we possibly can.
<TURN>
 there has to be an end point or you could go on well beyond <TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">january</TIMEX2>.
 recounting and recounting and recounting.
<TURN>
 unless the florida supreme court rules otherwise, al gore's attempt to overturn
 this election will be heard by a tallahassee judge on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">saturday</TIMEX2>.
 n tom?
<TURN>
 thanks very much, nbc's david bloom <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>.
 and in texas <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, governor bush had a conspicuous meeting with general colin
 powell who's widely expected to become secretary of state if the governor
 becomes president.
 nbc's david gregory is following that for us <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>.
 david?
<TURN>
 tom, eager to rebut the vice president's recent publicity blitz, <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> governor
 bush invites reporters to his ranch to vigorously defend the effort by
 florida's legislature, n but as you say to also shine the spotlight on the man
 who would become the star of his cabinet.
 growing visibly frustrated by his opponent's legal challenge, bush flanked
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> by his likely secretary of state, colin powell, insists when the counting
 stops he will be the president.
<TURN>
 i've won three counts, and i think it's time to get some finality to the
 process.
<TURN>
 but without such finality there is only the awkwardness of political limbo
 underscored by this exchange between bush and powell.
<TURN>
 thanks for having me, n and congratulations, governor, on your success in your
 election.
<TURN>
 while powell, who campaigned with bush, says he's not yet been asked to serve
 in a bush cabinet, he is, nevertheless, actively involved in forming the
 governor's national security team.
<TURN>
 it has always been my understanding that he would not move in that direction
 and begin appointing members of the cabinet until all of this matter is behind
 us and resolved.
<TURN>
 and <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> bush laughs in the face of questions that he's appeared out of touch
 lately by delegating so much of the transition work n to his running mate dick
 cheney.
<TURN>
 that's pretty humorous, dave.
 thank you all for coming.
<TURN>
 bush says <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> his transition office in northern virginia is "open for
 business," and though he complains about <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">lost time</TIMEX2>, his top aides say that he
 has "strong ideas" on who will fill the top jobs in the white house and in his
 cabinet.
 tom?
<TURN>
 thank you very much, nbc's david gregory <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> who is trying to introduce the
 n blue blazer to ranch wear.
