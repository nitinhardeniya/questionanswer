for some insight <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-01T21:11:31.77" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> how the supreme court may decide this 
case, we are joined by lawyers who have stood before the 
justices many times. harvard law school professor 
arthur miller has argued five cases. 
carter phillips is an appellate attorney who has argued 32 cases 
before the court. 23 of them in private practice. 
that's a modern-day record. there's a trophy in a trophy 
case somewhere. also with us attorney lis wiehl 
who counseled the democrats during the clinton impeachment 
trial. she is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-01T21:11:31.77" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> professor at the 
university of washington law school. 
professor miller, i'll start here and work across. 
it was fascinating watching this with you three <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, hearing 
your observations. what dynamic did you see emerge 
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>?
<TURN>
the dynamic that we saw <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> was absolutely at a central 
casting. that's what it's like every time 
those nine justices get on the bench. 
they control, they dominate, it's professional, it's 
intelligent, it's intensive. it made me sweat just watch -- 
just listening to it again. i think you also saw the 
phenomenon of the justices talking to each of them through 
the lawyers. every time you got the sense 
that there was advantage gore, the bush side would even it back 
up. and there were times when larry 
tribe, for example, didn't even have to be there because scalia 
and ginsburg were talking too each other. 
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that</TIMEX2>'s <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="predicate nominal, so no specific VAL">a fairly typical day</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
lis wiehl, this is a passive-aggressive court. 
they don't talk much to each other through conversation. 
but the conversation was extraordinary.
<TURN>
absolutely. i hope they didn't write too 
much of their speeches for the judges because they bearly got a 
word out before the judges were peppering them with questions. 
and that is, as professor miller said, the hallmark of fine 
argument by both sides and really good questions by the 
justices. it was a dynamic experience and 
i was sweating bullets here, too.
<TURN>
carter, let's talk about the factions. 
could you make a case that you could feel and hear five votes 
leaning bush, four votes leaning gore?
<TURN>
yeah, that's the way i would have interpreted it. 
because it seemed to me very clear that both the chief 
justice and justice scalia thought the reliance by the 
state supreme court by the constitution violated the united 
states constitution. justice o'connor could no vn 
clearer she thought there was a plain violation. 
dramatic change. the language was very strong. 
a couple questions by justice kennedy similarly suggested he 
didn't think there was a delegation by the standard that 
could satisfy the statutory requirements.
<TURN>
don't you want to be unanimous on such a huge topic?
<TURN>
obviously you'd love to persuade the other four to come 
to your side of the opinion. the american people had an 
opportunity to witness, although only orally, how the court 
operated. and i think if you were going to 
come around and say reasonable minds could differ anything, you 
would say this is a subject that could not require anonymity.
<TURN>
we're all going to be talking to you later, once more during 
<TIMEX2 val="PT1H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-01T21" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">the hour</TIMEX2>. thank you.
<TURN>
thank you.
