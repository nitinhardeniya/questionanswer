 George W. Bush has been busy on his first day in Washington since the
 presidential race ended last week. He has been meeting leaders from both
 sides of Congress and the President elect started the day breakfasting with
 Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan. Emily Harris reports.
<TURN>
 The President elect declined to say exactly what he discussed with Fed
 Chairman Greenspan but Bush came out of the session standing by his 1.3
 trillion-dollar tax cut plan he says would be an insurance policy against a
 possible economic slowdown. Greenspan has supported paying down the debt
 with tax surpluses. After the breakfast, Bush visited with Congressional
 leaders on Capitol Hill. Democrats promised to work with the President, but
 pushed for Bush to take a centrist position on controversial issues. The
 President elect is also interviewing possible cabinet members during his
 visit to Washington. Just one cabinet member Secretary of State Colin Powell
 has been named so far. For The World, I am Emily Harris in Washington.
