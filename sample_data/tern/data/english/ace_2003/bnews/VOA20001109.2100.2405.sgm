 US Defense Secretary William Cohen plans to travel next week to nine Middle
 Eastern Gulf states for meetings with regional leaders. Mr. Cohen will
 depart next Tuesday to visit Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, the United
 Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel, Jordan and Egypt. The Pentagon says, the
 Secretary will consult with defense officials in those countries and also
 visit US troops in the area. US forces in the Gulf have been on high alert,
 since last month's apparent terrorist bombing of the USS Cole, which killed
 17 sailors. An explosion struck the Cole, as it refueled in the Yemeni port
 of Aden.
