 president clinton says he's willing to meet separately with israeli and
 palestinian leaders if both sides work to end the mideast violence.
 the president proposed the talks in a call to palestinian leader yasser arafat.
 mr. clinton says he wants to see arafat and israeli prime minister ehud barak
 abide by promises to end the bloodshed made at <TIMEX2 val="2000-W42" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>'s emergency summit in
 egypt.
 a white house spokesman says arafat is reviewing the offer.
 meanwhile, some 30,000 anti-israeli protesters clashed with police in jordan.
 demonstrators from across the country traveled to a west bank border town to
 call for the return of palestinian refugees.
 the number of police and protesters who were injured is still not known.
