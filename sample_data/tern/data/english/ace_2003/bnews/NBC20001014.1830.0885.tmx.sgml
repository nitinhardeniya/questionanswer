 in "focus" <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this evening</TIMEX2> -- gender and addiction.
 a growing number of treatment centers are tailoring their programs to account
 for differences between men and women.
 nbc's betty rollin has our report.
<TURN>
 are you a baby or a big girl?
<TURN>
 nothing unusual about how susan welden and her two children -- brandon, 4, and
 lexey, 2 -- go about their <TIMEX2 val="TMO" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">morning</TIMEX2> routine.
 what's unusual is where they go about it -- not at home, but at par village, a
 publicly funded, long-term residential treatment center for drug and alcohol
 abusers in largo, florida.
 susan's drug of choice was alcohol.
 and like so many of these women, addiction began during a childhood that was
 far from happy.
<TURN>
 when i was 13, i started drinking with my friends.
 whenever i didn't want to deal with something, that was the route i took.
 "okay, let's go out and smoke a couple of joints or drink with my friends."
<TURN>
 par village is one of a growing number of treatment centers, both residential
 and outpatient, for women only.
 research shows women become addicts for different reasons than men and have
 different treatment needs -- for example, permission to bring their children
 along, a key factor in determining whether women stay in treatment or come in
 for treatment at all.
 par village has on-site day care, even head start.
 chief operating officer nancy hamilton studied one group to measure the effect
 of the children's presence on the women.
<TURN>
 they did better.
 they stayed longer.
 they completed at a higher rate.
 but the best thing was when you went out to look at them <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="I tagged this because it seems like 'later', but it is hard to give it a val. it is clearly nonspecific.">down the line</TIMEX2>, they
 were more likely to be clean, more likely to be free of the criminal justice
 system.
 and they were much more likely to have custody of their children.
<TURN>
 two-thirds of the women at par village take medicine for psychiatric illness,
 like depression and anxiety.
 mental illness is often a precursor to drug addiction among women, not the case
 among men.
<TURN>
 the depression, you know, using the drugs and then not figuring out why i was
 doing what i was doing.
<TURN>
 group therapy sessions help the women understand the role their mental illness
 plays in their addiction.
 everyone gets individual therapy, as well.
 dr. alan leshner is the director of the national institute on drug abuse.
<TURN>
 it has to be that the treatment addresses the underlying reasons and causes.
 so you need people to be in a situation where they're able to talk about their
 problems and deal with them.
<TURN>
 "underlying reasons and causes" of drug addiction are what these women are
 focused on at women in need, an outpatient center in new york city.
<TURN>
 it was my mother's boyfriend.
 i was <TIMEX2 val="P13Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">13 years old</TIMEX2>.
 he molested me.
<TURN>
 about 70% of all women in treatment report histories of sexual or physical
 abuse.
<TURN>
 it was normal for me if my boyfriend came home high and beat me up, because i
 watched my father do that to my mother.
<TURN>
 and most of the women here had at least one parent who was an addict.
<TURN>
 i took care of the house.
 i took care of her.
 she'd come home drunk.
 i'd have to undress her and put her to bed.
<TURN>
 it feels so good to get it out, because i've been holding it in so long.
 and i know by me holding it in, that's what was causing me to go use.
 go use.
 go use.
<TURN>
 these crucial personal revelations would be impossible with men around, the
 women say.
<TURN>
 you wouldn't feel the security, the safeness.
 you wouldn't be as honest, open and willing to speak about the things you have
 gone through.
 as a woman.
<TURN>
 women in need also offers day care, as well as other support services.
 research shows the programs that work best for female addicts, whether
 residential or outpatient, not only provide child care, psychiatric evaluation
 and women-only therapy, but practical help, so that they can function as
 nonaddicts.
 both par and women in need offer vocational, parenting and g.e.d. classes.
 and at par, the women learn the discipline of work by working at the center.
 is there hope for a woman like susan to maintain a life free of substance
 abuse, which she says she so wants for herself and her children?
 with programs that take into account her special needs, experts say there is
 more hope than ever before.
