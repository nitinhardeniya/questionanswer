 russian and norwegian divers have succeeded in cutting a hole in the sunken
 submarine "kursk."
 it took the divers five days to cut through the 16-inch hull.
 so far three bodies have been found.
 the nuclear-powered sub sank on august killing 118 russia sailors experts say
 the recovery may be long, risky and expensive.
 at least six more holes will have to be cut into the sub to allow access to
 each sealed-off compartment.
 russian officials blame a collision with another sub and promised to have proof
 within the next two months.
