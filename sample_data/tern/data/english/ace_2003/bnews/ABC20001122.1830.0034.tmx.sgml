 <TIMEX2 val="TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">good evening</TIMEX2>.
 americans are ready to pause for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the thanksgiving holiday</TIMEX2>.
 but there has been no paus in major events -- in the race for president.
 at <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-22" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the beginning of this day</TIMEX2>, the gore campaign was elated by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-21TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last night</TIMEX2>'s
 victory in the florida supreme court.
 the court saying, hand counts in thr florida counties must be included in the
 state vote totals.
 at <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-22" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of this day</TIMEX2>, it is the bush campaign that is pleased, because
 vote-rich miami-dade county decided to stop recounting.
 the gore camp had hoped to pick up many votes there.
 and if that weren't enough, there was the news that republican vice
 presidential candidate dick cheney had a minor heart attack <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>.
 we cover all of it <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-22TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, starting with that decision in miami.
 here's abc's bill redeker.
 bill?
 bill redeker?
 do you hear me, bill?
<TURN>
 what happened here <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> was of enormous importance to both political parties
 because the democrats had said all along that this was the place that there
 were enough recounted votes that they could gather to win the presidency.
 but that was before the recount collapsed.
 the decision came after frustrated board members said there were too many
 ballots, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">too little time</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 we cannot meet the deadline of the supreme court of the state of florida.
<TURN>
 that came as a surprise because only <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-22TXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a few hours earlier</TIMEX2>, the board voted in
 favor of a limited hand recount of the ballots the machines missed.
<TURN>
 simply hand count the undercounted ballots, approximately 10,750.
<TURN>
 republican attorneys argued that to not recount the entire county could
 disenfranchise some voters in miami's powerful hispanic community.
<TURN>
 you will be violated the rights of the hispanic community.
<TURN>
 that enraged observers.
 then there was this.
<TURN>
 let us see the ballots.
<TURN>
 republican demanded access to the recount room.
<TURN>
 let us in!
<TURN>
 they charged a democratic attorney and demanded police arrest him for stealing
 a ballot.
 it turned out to be a sample or practice ballot.
 the incident left an impression on the board.
<TURN>
 i was convinced that it would be perceived as not a fair and open process.
<TURN>
 it was a big win for the republicans who brought in the governor of montana,
 among other politicians, to rally the faithful.
<TURN>
 we believe that miami-dade county canvassing board made the right decision for
 the right reasons.
 they, in he is seps, said there is a limit.
<TURN>
 the democrats headed back to court again to try to force the board to
 reconsider again.
 they have asked for an emergency hearing because of the supreme court deadline
 of <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="lowercase">sunday</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 bill redeker in miami.
