 finally this evening -- history acknowledged.
 we don't need to tell you that this is an important moment in american history.
 our final report reminds us how history can evolve through the lens of time.
 it's about the civil war and recognition for service.
 here's abc's john martin.
<TURN>
 they were black sailors and between 1861 and 1865, they fought the civil war on
 nearly 700 ships of the union navy.
<TURN>
 on some ships, more than 0% of the crew were african-american.
<TURN>
 for 135 years, nobody knew the whole story, just bits and pieces.
 but now, thanks to this man, all the names, 18,000 men and a dozen women, are
 finally known.
<TURN>
 george anderson.
 monroe armstrong.
 noah ark.
 this is not as uncommon as it might appear.
<TURN>
 what is uncommon was historian joseph reidy's determination.
 for <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">20 years</TIMEX2> he nurtured the dream of finding their story here at the national
 archives.
 unlikehe union army, the union navy was not segregated, nor were i records,
 which is why, over eight years, reidy and a team of researchers had to examine
 every file.
<TURN>
 <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-17" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">day</TIMEX2> after <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-17" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">day</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="TMO" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">morning</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="TNI" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">night</TIMEX2>, we would go into the archives, set ourselves
 up, open up one of these oversize muster roll volumes and just go through line
 by line.
<TURN>
 <TIMEX2 val="P8Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">eight years</TIMEX2>?
<TURN>
 at times, it was like a marathon.
 we wondered if it would ever end.
<TURN>
 what they found is startling.
 blacks could not become commissioned officers, so they became pretty officers,
 cooks, deck hands.
 15% of the entire navy was black.
<TURN>
 i said then that i was <TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1980" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">30 years old</TIMEX2> a@ <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that time</TIMEX2>, but i was not.
 i wanted to be regarded as a man.
 and southern people always regard a black man as a boy until he gets to be
 <TIMEX2 val="P99Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about 99 years old</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 they came from all over, escaped slaves, volume freerz abroad, making their
 relatives proud.
<TURN>
 john robert bond was born in england.
 he came to the united states because he wanted to help to fight to free the
 slaves.
<TURN>
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, a black navy admiral saluted reid kbr's research j with a wreath.
 <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-17T18:55:06.43" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> that the sailors have been identified, compiling their stories could take
 joseph and his team <TIMEX2 val="P1DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-17" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">a decade longer</TIMEX2>.
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, the navy opened a website to spread the word.
