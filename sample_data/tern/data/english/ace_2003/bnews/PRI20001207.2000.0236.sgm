 Reports from Russia say there may be a presidential pardon in store for
 Edmund Pope, the American convicted yesterday in Moscow on spying charges.
 The head of Russia's Presidential Pardons Commission says the commission
 would recommend that President Vladimir Putin free Pope. The commission is
 expected to take up Pope's case tomorrow. A Moscow court sentenced Pope to
 20 years in prison for allegedly trying to buy secret information about a
 high-speed Russian submarine. Pope maintains that he is innocent and says he
 should be released because he is suffering from a rare form of bone cancer.
