 the summit is coinciding with more unrest in several areas of the west bank and
 gaza strip.
 hundreds of stone-throwing palestinians stormed the israeli-controlled section
 of hebron, breaking a curfew imposed since the outbreak of the unrest last
 month.
 witnesses said israeli soldiers fired live ammunition and rubber-coated metal
 bullets, wounding at least seven people.
 thousands of palestinian demonstrators marched in the area to protest against a
 renewal of contacts with israel.
