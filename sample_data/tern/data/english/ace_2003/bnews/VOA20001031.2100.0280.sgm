 In Moscow, the spy trial of an American businessman has been adjourned until
 Thursday. The adjournment came after defendant Edmund Pope suffered a
 serious bout of joint pain and was rushed to a prison clinic. The US
 embassy in Moscow has again asked that Mr. Pope be released on the grounds
 that he needs to be seen by an American doctor. He is accused of attempting
 to steal Russian torpedo technology.
