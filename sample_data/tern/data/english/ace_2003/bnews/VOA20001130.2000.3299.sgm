 For nearly 20 years, the world has faced the challenge posed by AIDS. Since
 1988, the first day of December has been designated by the United Nations as
 World AIDS Day. This is the time to disseminate information and faster
 cooperation in the battle against AIDS, the number one cause of infectious
 disease in the world. The picture of the epidemic is bleak. According to a
 new UN study, in the past year over five million people have been infected
 with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Since the beginning of the epidemic,
 about 22 million people have died of the disease. While infections among
 adults are decreasing, infections among children are increasing. Many of
 these cases are in sub-Saharan Africa where infected mothers are
 transmitting the virus to their babies during delivery. Africa accounts
 for more than four-fifths of the world's AIDS-related deaths. In some
 African countries, one out of four adults is infected with HIV. But Eastern
 Europe has seen the biggest explosion of new infections. In Russia, the
 rate of infection has more than doubled this year to 300,000. South and
 Southeast Asia are other high-risk areas with five and three quarter million
 adults and children now living with HIV or AIDS. In too many places,
 discussion of AIDS is taboo and the disease is shrouded in mystery and
 misinformation. But as the grim statistics make clear, it is critical that
 the governments and citizens of those nations most affected by AIDS, do
 their part to recognize the scope of the epidemic and act decisively to
 confront it. As President Bill Clinton said, we must work together to break
 the silence, to fight the stigmatization and protect the rights of those
 living with HIV and AIDS, and to help those infected find the care and
 treatment they need. We must pledge to stay the course in our crusade until
 the world is finally freed from the shadow of this devastating epidemic.
