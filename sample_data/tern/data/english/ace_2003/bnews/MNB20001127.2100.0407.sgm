there are indications tonight that americans are making up 
their own minds about where they see this race for president no 
matter what al gore says about where it stands. 
in a "washington post"/abc news poll taken right after florida 
certified bush as the winner in that state and of its electoral 
votes, 60% said gore should concede the race now. 
35% said he should continue to battle on in the courts. 
joining us tonight to talk more about the mood of the american 
people, howard fineman, the chief political correspondent 
for "newsweek"" magazine. he's with us tonight from our 
washington bureau. howard, it is what the news 
media are criticized for, dwelling on the personalities of 
the candidates, aspects of their personality like sincerity, 
disingenuousness. however, it's the way a lot of 
americans will judge al gore's appearance tonight as they get 
it over their television sets. having said that, how do you 
think he did?
<TURN>
well, as long as we're talking style points, brian, i 
think it was not helpful to t vice president to have the photo 
flash going throughout the entire speech. 
it was really a distraction, number one. 
that was really unfortunate just as a matter of style on 
television, i think. it got in the way of his commaun 
kating his message. number two, i think he had a 
very tough thing to do which was to be both personal and lofty at 
the same time. it's tough to find the middle 
distance on that. and i must say i'm not entirely 
sure he did it. he had to make clear to people 
there was something about him, some essential goodness in him, 
that made it worth fighting this fight. 
and when he said, if i lose, so be it, he had to be convincing 
on that point. and i must say after all the 
arguing in this very divided election it's going to be hard 
for most americans to agree with that. 
the additional problem he had substantively is he had to be a 
prosecutor and victim at the same time. 
he had to say here are the reasons why this election was 
rotten in florida. and i think he probably needed 
to take more time and be more specific than he was. 
he talked about organized intimidation in florida. 
that's something that a lot of democrats are very upset about. 
well, exactly what is it, mr. vice president? 
he had the duty to explain that more clearly but he didn't want 
to get into too much detail. he has to be the aggrieved 
victim. how do you do both at the same 
time? he's in a difficult position 
both in terms of the argument and the theater and the 
substance of it. in these polls i'm sure the 
media will be criticized for this, too. 
polls have a way of reinforcing each other sometimes. 
it's what somebody wrote a book about called the tipping effect 
where a majority of people decide that's the reality they 
want to see. that's what al gore's fighting 
against now, that slowly closing door of the majority saying 
enough is enough. and also he said that we need to 
come together as a country and after an election that was fair. 
most americans believe is fair. the problem he has, at least 
superficially, most americans think this election was fair. 
he's got to make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him 
to do it.

howard, first of all your point on the flashes. 
someone in the gore media office may be in deep trouble tonight. 
these events can of course be photographed without flashes. 
witness every time the president addresses the nation from the 
oval office. it can be done. 
number two, all day long in the news media you have heard 
analysts use this very same question i gave to you. implied as 
part of that, of course, is there is some perception out 
there, a growing one, that george w. bush won this 
election.
<TURN>
there are people who -- somebody just said he has until 
-- i think tim said a lot of his sources said he has until the 
supreme court speaks and maybe until december 12 as the drop 
dead date. for democrats and for al gore, 
that may be the very, very outside. 
in other words that's the last possible day. 
the problem is getting from here to there politically. 
yes, the supreme court isn't going to hear arguments till 
friday. yes, the florida court is going 
to take its sweet time. but in political terms i'm not 
sure how much time he really has. 
and if he has two weeks.
<TURN>
howard fineman from our washington bureau tonight, thank 
you very much for that, howard.
<TURN>
sure.
