 <TIMEX2 val="TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">good evening</TIMEX2>.
 we are all going to be very familiar with this map in <TIMEX2 val="P5D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-01" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the remaining days of the
 presidential campaign</TIMEX2>.
 those are the battleground states where this election will be won or lost.
 where neither mr. bush nor mr. gore have managed to get a lead and hold on to
 it.
 there are <TIMEX2 val="P5D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-01" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">five days left to campaign</TIMEX2> for the 270 electoral votes which the
 winner needs.
 and as of <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, there is a possibility that one man could win the popular
 vote and the other the electoral vote, which would make him the winner.
 we start with 25 of those.
 they belong in florida.
 25 very important votes.
 which is why al gore <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> is making this visit to this tossup state since
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">march</TIMEX2>.
 abc's terry moran is there.
 terry?
 i wonder if itses as tense on the ground as it looks at a distance?
<TURN>
 it is, peter.
 they feel good about their chances in florida.
 they plan to win here since <TIMEX2 val="2000-SP" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last spring</TIMEX2> when a lot of people thought their
 effort here was a bluff.
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s trip marked an effort to seal the deal.
 in kissimmee, outside orlando, al gore was reaching out to the democratic base
 of senior citizens preaching the old-time democratic gospel.
<TURN>
 social security itself is on the ballot.
 you will vote and you will choose.
 and i ask you to save social security.
<TURN>
 citing a report by the american academy of actuaries that was critical of both
 candidates' social security proposals, gore emphasized the group's finding that
 governor bush had not adequately accounted for the cost of his plan.
<TURN>
 he said he rejects their premise.
 well, which premise?
 addition or subtraction?
<TURN>
 but it wasn't all about senior citizens <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>.
 gore campaigned in the critical i-4 corridor, along the interstate from orlando
 to tampa where an influx of younger suburban hispanic and independent voters
 have dramatically altered the old political calculus here.
 so gore tailored his attack on bush's social security plan targeting younger
 workers.
<TURN>
 benefits for middle-aged workers would have to be cut deeply.
 77 wasted away again 77
<TURN>
 and in tampa, where singer jimmy buffett stoked the crowd awaiting the vice
 president, gore emphasized an issue of major importance to younger voters all
 along florida's gulf coast -- offshore oil drilling.
<TURN>
 i will ban all new oil and gas drilling off the coast of florida and
 california.
<TURN>
 this is the last time al gore will visit florida.
 his own staff says the race is too close to call and will likely depend on
 turnout.
 as the state's democratic party chairman put it, thinking about the impact
 weather can have on voter turnout, this race could hinge on a thunderstorm in
 miami <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next tuesday</TIMEX2>.
 peter?
<TURN>
 thanks very much, terry.
 terry moran in florida.
 the republicans were trying in florida <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>.
 general norman schwarzkopf campaigning with dick cheney said, "we're in a war
 right now to convince the seniors that their social security benefits are safe
 with bush."
 he uses the right word, it is a war out there.
 while al gore was after the 25 electoral votes in florida, mr. bush was trying
 to win the 11 in washington state and the 10 in minnesota.
 abc's dean reynolds is in duluth.
 dean?
<TURN>
 minnesota is one of those states that bush would clearly like to win and if he
 loses one of the big ones <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next tuesday</TIMEX2> like pennsylvania or florida, he may
 have to.
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2> began with the kind of moment that faces all politicians from <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time to
 time</TIMEX2>, when one of the fishmongers along the seattle waterfront apparently
 mistook bush for al gore.
<TURN>
 hello, mr. vice president.
<TURN>
 undaunted, the texas governor's visit ensured him a place on the local news and
 then, he was off to minnesota.
 with ten electoral votes, minnesota has gone democratic in every presidential
 election since <TIMEX2 val="1972" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1972</TIMEX2> and the bush campaign had all but ignored the state.
 but recent polls suggest bush has a chance to break that streak.
 because minnesota has a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-26T18:39:18.31" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> history of bucking politic tal trepds.
 after all, jesse ventura was elected governor and gave ross perot 20% of its
 vote in <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2>.
 the campaign believes bush's attacks on gore's spending plans are resonating
 with the public.
<TURN>
 my opponent offers an old and tired approach.
<TURN>
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> the governor unveiled a long list of federal programs he claimed gore
 could create or expand.
<TURN>
 his is a plan of spending without discipline.
 spending without priorities.
 and spending without an end.
<TURN>
 while styling himself as a unifying force for what he insists is much-needed
 change, bush went on to say gore is out of touch with the country.
<TURN>
 just when progress on important issues seems within reach, my opponent has left
 the vital center of american politics.
<TURN>
 peter, there's another element to bush's strategy.
 it involves taking advantage of ralph nader.
 the green party candidate who is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-26T18:39:18.31" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">currently</TIMEX2> pulling about 10% of the vote here
 in minnesota according to polls.
 enough to deny al gore victory and turn the state over to governor bush.
<TURN>
 thanks very much, dean reynolds.
 ralph nader making more news <TIMEX2 val="2000-W44" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> thany he has in others.
 he represents the green party.
 he was campaigning in the fiercely contested toss-up state of wisconsin with
 its electoral votes <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>.
 abc's dan harris is with him.
<TURN>
 ralph nader campaigning in madison <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> despite mounting criticism that he
 might cost al gore the election.
 his top priority is creating a viable third party for <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-01T18:30:31.93" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the future</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 those two parties have sold off our democracy and they've got to be challenged.
<TURN>
 at every stop, he talks about universal health care, stronger labor unions and
 publicly financed campaigns.
<TURN>
 big business is on a collision course with our democracy and our democracy is
 losing.
<TURN>
 he is facing increasing venom from the left.
 democrats are holding concerts, staging news conferences and circulate ing
 letters calling on nader to drop out or ask his supporters in battleground
 states around the country to support gore.
 many nader supporters say they are immune to the pressure.
<TURN>
 beef got to make a statement.
 we're going to have to lose something in order to gain something.
<TURN>
 there are some nervous nader voters people who want the green party to get
 enough votes to receive federal funding in the next election but don't want to
 see george w. bush in the white house.
 on the internet, a possible solution.
 websites seeking nader supporters in contested states who are willing to vote
 for gore.
 in exchange, gore backers in states where the race is not competitive promise
 to vote for nader.
 in the face of all this, nader's operation is morphing from an ad hoc,
 low-budget operation to something resembling a real campaign.
 he now has an entourage, complete with security guards and a small group of
 reporters.
 and he's launching a new round of ads.
<TURN>
 when i grow up --
<TURN>
 i want to be disillusioned.
<TURN>
 nader likes neither gore nor bush.
<TURN>
 i would be very astonished that al gore running budget surpluses in a booming
 economy could not have landslided a bumbling governor from texas with a
 terrible record.
 if he can't do that, what good is he?
<TURN>
 with <TIMEX2 val="P6D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-01" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">only six days</TIMEX2> left, this election may hinge on the man one aide calls "one
 of the most stubborn people in the united states."
