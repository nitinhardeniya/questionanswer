 Beginning early next year, visitors to Eusemmite National Park in California
 will see some changes. A new plan is aimed at protecting the giant sequoia
 trees, scenic valleys, and waterfalls from the impact of four million
 tourists a year. Under the new plan, visitors will have very limited access
 to the park by car. The 343 million-dollar plan will create a new shuttle
 bus system to alleviate traffic congestion. It will also remove roads from
 meadows, create more hiking trails, and restore campsites damaged by a 1997
 flood. Eusemmite spokesman Scott Gidman says while these measures have been
 controversial, the preservation effort will not sacrifice visitor enjoyment.

 And so we certainly do not want to limit access or will not limit access to
 the National Park, but we need to design the facilities, design parking
 areas, design the infrastructure in a way that we can handle these large
 amounts of people.

 Eusemmite is not alone in seeking new management strategies to preserve
 natural areas. Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona is putting in a light
 rail system. And Zion National Park in Utah has just established a new
 shuttle bus system. With environment briefs, I'm Roseanne Scerbal.
