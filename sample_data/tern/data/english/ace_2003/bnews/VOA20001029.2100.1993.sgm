 The US navy destroyer damaged apparently by a terrorist bomb while refueling
 at the Red Sea port, Aden has begun it's journey back to the States for
 repair. As Dave Gavlak reports, the US Cole was towed out of the Aden
 harbor to awaiting Norwegian transport ship, that will actually carry the
 damaged destroyer home.

 The American national anthem played as four tug boats pulled the USS Cole
 slowly out of Yemen's Southern port of Aden. The Cole was badly damaged two
 weeks ago in an apparent suicide bombing that killed 17 US sailors.
 Security was tight as the ship was towed out. American and Yemeni patrol
 boats mounted with machine guns escorted the Cole out to open waters while
 American helicopters flew overhead. Some Yemenis expressed relief to see
 the ship leave. Many locals said they feared the bombing of the ship would
 serve as an excuse for continued US military presence in the Gulf country.
 Diplomats and analysts have commented that a joint investigation into the
 attack may in fact strengthen ties between the world super power and the
 poor, but strategic Arab state. US and Yemeni officials say they believe
 Islamic militants may have carried out the bombing. So far two little known
 Islamic groups have claimed responsibility for the attack. Yemeni
 authorities claimed they have detained over 70 people for questioning.
 These include some Afghan-Arab volunteers who came to Yemen after fighting
 against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Dave Gavlak for VOA
 News, Cairo.
