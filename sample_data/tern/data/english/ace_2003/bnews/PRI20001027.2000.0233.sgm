 It's 65 degrees at 8:04. Good evening, I am Nels Hobdell, WHYY, FM News.
 Philadelphia teachers walked off the job with the close of school this
 afternoon without setting out a specific timeframe. Mayor John Street then told
 reporters that he would talk to the governor before tolerating a painful
 drawn-out strike. Federation of Teachers, Chief Ted Kirsch also made a public
 statement. He pointed out that a number of differences still separated the two
 sides.

 There are some issues that are not about the money. And there is an issue of
 dignity, and there is an issue of professionalism, and when you impose and you
 pass laws to punish people, that's an insult. And so when people today wonder
 why at the end of the workday, the PFT members were outside wearing their red
 shirts, it wasn't just as that Mayor tried to characterize it, as one or two
 differences, there are a whole lot of differences.

 Mr. Kirsch spoke live on WHYY FM through the courtesy of FOX News, TB 29.
