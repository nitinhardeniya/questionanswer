 many people in north america will be able to experience a partial solar eclipse
 tomorrow.
 but scientists say it won't block much christmas sunlight in most places.
 as always, eclipse fans are being warned not to look directly at the sun
 because that can cause permanent eye damage.
 the eclipse will occur at around p.m. eastern time.
 the best view will be in the northeast.
