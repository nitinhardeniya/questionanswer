 with the presidential debate tonight in st. louis,
 the candidates will be in the middle of a hot political
 issue that's not getting much national attention --
 what to do about the missouri river, the fabled waterway
 of lewis and clark that joins the mississippi in st. louis.
 it's a far different river now than it once was,
 and the question is -- should it be allowed to return
 to its true form? nbc's national correspondent
 is jim avila.

 the wide missouri, pioneers called it  --
 too thick to drink, too thin to plow.
 a shallow, slow moving, swampy river that birds and fish loved
 in its natural state. 
<TURN>
 the ebb and flow in a river like the missouri provides
 the basis for life itself. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 but the missouri is no longer wild, tamed by dams
 and dredging. now a shipping highway
 the government says endangers the very existence of three
 critical river species -- the 100 million-year-old pallid
 sturgeon, the shore-wading the least tern.
 the missouri's natural rhythm destroyed, say the experts,
 by six dams in a system from north central montana
 to the mississippi river. a transformation turning
 the meandering river into essentially a deep water
 ditch. 
<TURN>
 without providing the higher flow in the spring and the lower
 flow in the summer that missouri river species are adapted to,
 they're going to disappear. today's sturgeon can't reproduce
 in the river any more, only in man-made hatcheries and sand
 bars, homes to wading birds are being
 washed away by deep water. so to save fish and birds
 and improve recreational use in up-river states, where
 tourism is a major source of income,
 the government wants to alter 50 years of steady water flow.
 re-creating the original river by releasing more water
 in spring, less in summer -- fighting words for downriver
 farmers and barge operators. 
<TURN>
 try explaining that times have changed, nonsense
 to the people who live along the missouri river and don't
 want to go back to the spring floods.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 it's about the water and who controls
 it. the missouri, second longest
 river in the country. 7 states, 2,500 miles long
 and now according to conservationists, second
 on the list of rivers in danger. farmers say it's the planting
 season that's in danger if the missouri isn't controlled
 in spring. and barge owners say two dry
 months in the summer will ruin business.
<TURN>
 what this proposal does is double the cost of operation
 on the missouri river and will cause those companies to move
 off the river. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 but according to
 figures  from the u.s. corps
 of army engineers, the four grain producing states
 along the missouri, producing nearly 5 billion bushels
 of grain each year, ship very little by barge now.
 16.7 million bushels. that's .3%.
<TURN>
 the barge companies do not own the missouri river.
 the flood plain farmers do not own the missouri river.
 everybody owns it. we have to find a way to share
 the missouri. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 and say environmentalists save three
 threatened  species and a leisure
 economy dependent upon a wide, untamed missouri.
