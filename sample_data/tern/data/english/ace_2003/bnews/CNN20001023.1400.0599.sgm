 in the barents sea, high winds have halted divers' recovery efforts on the
 sunken russian submarine "kursk."
 it's not clear when work will resume.
 deep-sea divers are trying to recover the remains of the 118 submariners who
 were killed when an explosion crippled the vessel.
 they hope to cut seven holes through both hulls to pull bodies out.
 but safety fears, stemming from metal debris and the submarine's two nuclear
 reactors, may force the russian navy to call off the work.
