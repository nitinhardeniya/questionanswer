 in tokyo <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, the parliament passed new laws on juvenile crime.
 children as young as 14 may now be tried as adults.
 mark litke reports from tokyo.
<TURN>
 it is no longer that unusual -- three violent juvenile crimes make the national
 news on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a single day</TIMEX2>.
 an extortion, an assault, a murder ba boy who said he wanted to know what it
 felt like to kill.
 shocked and worried japanese have no shortage of explanations.
 too much video game violence, not enough parental supervision, too few job
 opportunities.
 but many now believe the roots go much deeper.
 that <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">decades of excessive pressure to succeed at school and to sacrifice all
 for one's job</TIMEX2> have crippled traditional family values in japan, creating
 something of a lost generation.
 kids on the stre <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-28T18:51:02.39" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> speak openly about feeling a sense of rage or wanting to
 strike out, a nothing-to-lose mentality with no traditional sense of shame for
 failure.
 and many do fail.
 jails and reform schools for young japanese are filled to capacity.
 abc news was allowed a rare visit to a reform school here we were not allowed
 to speak with or identify the young offenders, but counselor kenji otsudo says
 many of these kids are loners with no self-esteem.
 the school tries to provide the attention they never received at home or
 school, a mix of education, discipline and chores, with <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time for team sports</TIMEX2> to
 emphasize group responsibility.
 sociologists here say these schools are a good start, but they fear japan's
 juvenile crime crisis may only be just beginning.
 one sign was visible on live television <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-28T18:51:02.39" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> as millions of viewers watched
 a bus hijacking by a teenager armed with a kitchen knife.
 before it was over, he had stabbed three women, killing one.
 he told police he wanted revenge against the parents and society he hated.
 and, he wanted to be famous.
