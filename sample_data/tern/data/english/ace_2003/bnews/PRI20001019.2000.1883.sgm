 Britain's going to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea. Foreign
 Secretary Robin Cook made the announcement on his arrival in the South Korean
 capital, Seoul. But Cook says establishing ties with North Korea doesn't mean
 London will turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in the country.

 We have diplomatic relations around the world, we are going to find out who is
 a human rights breaker, we have very deep and very real concerns. The advantage
 of having diplomatic relations is that we can have a direct dialogue in which
 we can raise these concerns and express our deep anxiety for the need of
 improvement in them.

 Cook says the South Korean leadership is keen on international help in bringing
 its northern neighbor in from the cold.
