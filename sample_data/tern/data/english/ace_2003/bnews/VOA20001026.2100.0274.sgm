 A Russian scientist has told a Moscow City court that the information an
 American businessman allegedly tried to purchase about a Russian torpedo is
 commonly available and not a state secret. The scientist, an expert on the
 torpedo and a defense witness at the trial of businessman Edmund Pope said
 he had often used the torpedo information for his research and had spoken
 openly about it. A defense lawyer said the testimony would help his client.
