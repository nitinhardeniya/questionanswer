 the u.s. navy is revising the timeline of last week's attack on the "uss cole."
 it says the explosion happened more than two hours after the ship was tied to a
 fuel dock, not during the mooring operation, as previously thought.
 some wonder then, how the terrorists' boat could have escaped notice, since
 there should have been no other boats near the "cole."
 the navy says the sailors may have thought the small boat was there to help
 free the "cole" from lines tying it to the fuel dock.
 officials in yemen say they found bombmaking materials at a nearby apartment.
 fbi agents in yemen have taken swabs of explosive residue found in the
 apartment, and have sent them to washington for analysis.
