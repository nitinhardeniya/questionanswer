 An apparent attack on a US warship has left at least six American sailors
 dead and about 35 injured. The explosion came as the guided-missile
 destroyer USS Cole was refueling at a port in Yemen.
 NPR's Chad Pergram reports.

 Both the White House and the Pentagon said the attack appeared to be an act
 of terrorism. President Clinton immediately whisked to the region
 investigative teams from the FBI, the Pentagon and the State Department. The
 attack comes as US forces in the Middle East have been placed on a
 heightened state of alert after days of clashes between Israelis and
 Palestinians. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the US would continue to
 protect its interests around the globe.

 No one should doubt our resolve to remain a force for peace and for
 stability and no one should assume that they can force us to retreat. No one
 should assume they can attack us with impunity.

 The Cole had just arrived in the harbor for a refueling stop. Officials say
 men aboard this small boat had been assisting the Cole with mooring lines
 just before the blast. Chad Pergram ,NPR News, Washington.
