another major story we are following tonight. 
wall street's big plunge. the street was rocked by 
today's world news about more bad news about earnings as 
well. the dow fell more than 379 
points, fifth largest single point loss ever. 
it closed at 10,034, getting very close to that benchmark. 
nasdaq dropped almost 94, closing at 3074, its lowest 
single closing level of the year. 
for more now on the market turmoil and what might be 
ahead, we are joined tonight by cnbc's sue hererra.

geek, brian. it was quite a day on wall 
street. one of the toughest that 
traders that i've had a chance to talk to have seen in quite a 
long time. you've mentioned some of the 
reasons why. but the interesting thing is 
that a lot of these different events kind of happened all at 
once, combining to provide the dow with a really wild ride. 
it certainly was pegged on the middle east situation. 
also those profit warnings here in the u.s. 
and it combined to give the dow jones industrial average its 
fifth biggest point loss in history. 
now, we should add on a percentage basis it's not even 
in the top 100. but if you're along the market 
or in other words if you're holding stocks in this market, 
it certainly was a day that made a lot of people very 
queasy, and sources that i'm talking to say this was not the 
bottom. it's want over yet.
<TURN>
sue, it took the middle east and it took a company like home 
depot to indicate that the domestic economy was kind of 
slowing down to really speak the markets today. 
overseas i know trading has already started. 
any indications, foreign or domestically, what we're in 
for?
<TURN>
tokyo so far, when i last checked, which was about five 
minutes ago, was down 300 points. 
that's not a great fall, but it is an indication that tokyo is 
reacting to wall street's demise today. 
the traders that i had a chance to talk to tonight right before 
i came on are all looking for a rocky open tomorrow. 
we may get a little bit of a bounce, but it's a friday, the 
situation in the middle east is still certainly unsettled, to 
say the least. and very few people, 
institutional traders or individual investors are going 
to want to go home long stocks, in other words buying a large 
group of stocks. we also have the election 
coming up. so there's an awful lot of 
events still ahead for the market. 
so nervousness is going to be the word tomorrow, and in 
addition to that, probably continued selling is what i'm 
hearing, at least so far.
<TURN>
sue herera from cnbc, a pleasure. 
thanks for coming on.
<TURN>
thank you, brian.
