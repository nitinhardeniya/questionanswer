 Two more US space shuttle Discovery astronauts will be dispatched on a space
 walk later today to continue outfitting the International Space Station.
 VOA's science correspondent David McAlary reports that the excursion will be
 the second of four outside the shuttle as astronauts prepare the station for
 the start of permanent occupancy next month.

 Astronauts Jeff Leshoff and Mike Lopez Alagrio take their turns Monday for
 a six and a half hour outing to put finishing touches on a structure that
 Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata attached to the US module Saturday using
 the shuttle crane. It is an 860 kilogram cast aluminum cubical truss
 housing antennas, gyroscopes to control the station's motion and heaters to
 keep the equipment warm in frigid space temperatures. Mr. Wakata will
 manipulate the crane again Monday to attach another docking port to the US
 station segment. It will be another entry to which future shuttles can
 connect. On Sunday, astronauts Bill McArthur and Lee Roy Chow conducted the
 first space walk to lay electric power and data cables to the truss
 equipment and to reposition a dish antenna. The shuttle crew is preparing
 the station for the first long duration team that is to arrive in two and a
 half weeks. David McAlary, VOA News, Washington.
