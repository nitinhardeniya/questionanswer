 Edmund Pope has already spent 8 months in a Russian jail. Now the former
 naval officer faces a total of 20 years behind bars. A court in Moscow found
 him guilty of spying for the United States by obtaining top-secret
 information on a Russian torpedo. President Clinton had personally
 intervened in the case asking for the American businessman to be freed on
 health grounds. Mr. Pope suffers from a rare form of bone cancer. Steve
 Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow.
