 In 1998, the United States voted against the creation of the World's first
 permanent International War Crimes Court. President Clinton still has a
 chance to sign the treaty creating the Court before a final deadline this
 Sunday. Advocates are pressing him to do just that, but Conservatives in
 Congress and Pentagon officials don't want the US to join the treaty. The
 World's Jeb Sharp explains why.
<TURN>
 Jesse Helms, the Conservative and powerful Chairman of the Senate Foreign
 Relations Committee, has made it clear the Rome's statuette would be dead on
 arrival if it were brought to Congress for ratification. But proponents of
 the permanent International Criminal Court would still like to see President
 Clinton at least sign the treaty before the New Year's eve deadline.
 Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch says Clinton's signature would be an
 important symbolic gesture.
<TURN>
 What he will accomplish is making a clear statement that the United States
 not only in the former Yugoslavia, not only in Rwanda, not only in Cambodia,
 not only in Sierra Leone, where the administration has supported efforts at
 justice, but worldwide the United States supports the rule of law and
 supports holding those accused of genocide to account under the highest
 standards of due process.
<TURN>
 But the opposition here in the United States is intense. It comes mainly
 from the Pentagon where US military officials fear the Court will leave
 Americans vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions. Negotiators
 have tried to include safeguards in the treaty to address those fears, but
 stop short of exempting US personnel from prosecution. John Boltan of the
 American Enterprise Institute shares the Pentagon's objections.
<TURN>
 I think there is every prospect such a court and its prosecutor would be
 highly politicized and the principal target of a court like this might well
 turn out to be the United States or Israel or other countries like that.
<TURN>
 Boltan says that almost happened at the War Crimes Tribunal for the former
 Yugoslavia in The Hague, when Chief Prosecutor Carla Delponte briefly
 contemplated an investigation of NATO's bombing campaign against Serbia in
 1999. But proponents of the court say it's healthy for the United States
 and its allies to come under the same scrutiny as other countries. Richard
 Dicker of Human Rights Watch says Delponte's handling of the NATO case was
 exemplary.
<TURN>
 Carla Delponte was acting as any responsible prosecutor must when she
 receives credible allegations of wrongdoing. She looked into those
 allegations and then after an appropriate investigation she dismissed them.
<TURN>
 Richard Dicker says President Clinton should keep the promise he made to the
 Rwandan people in 1998 when he told survivors of the genocide there the
 United States would support the International Court. But John Balton of the
 American Enterprise Institute says a Clinton signature in the face of stiff
 domestic opposition would be meaningless.
<TURN>
 I think it's a symbolic act that doesn't achieve much, but I don't think
 anybody internationally should think that whatever President Clinton does
 will have the slightest impact on the next administration.
<TURN>
 Despite American objections, the International Criminal Court enjoys wide
 support worldwide and among major US allies. 131 countries have signed the
 treaty, 7 today and 25 have ratified it. 60 nations in all must ratify the
 treaty for the International Criminal Court to come into existence. That's
 expected to happen, with or without US support, in 2002. For The World, I'm
 Jeb Sharp.
