 We have had some really startling news <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>. We just heard a little
 while ago that Hillary Rodham Clinton has been elected to the United States
 Senate from the State of New York. That was clearly the most-watched Senate
 race in the entire country. And so there will be a Clinton going to
 Washington in <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2001</TIMEX2>. But it won't be Bill, it will be Hillary. And so I
 would think there would be a lot of speculation <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:05:56.30" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> about her place in the
 Senate and what <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:05:56.30" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2> political move she might have. But she has won quite
 a victory <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> in New York over Congressmen Rick Lazio, the Republican
 from Long Island.
<TURN>
 And it is again quite historic. It's the first time ever that a first lady
 has ever run for and <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:05:56.30" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, apparently, won a Congressional seat. Quite a
 remarkable story.
