 We have had some really startling news tonight. We just heard a little
 while ago that Hillary Rodham Clinton has been elected to the United States
 Senate from the State of New York. That was clearly the most-watched Senate
 race in the entire country. And so there will be a Clinton going to
 Washington in 2001. But it won't be Bill, it will be Hillary. And so I
 would think there would be a lot of speculation now about her place in the
 Senate and what future political move she might have. But she has won quite
 a victory tonight in New York over Congressmen Rick Lazio, the Republican
 from Long Island.

 And it is again quite historic. It's the first time ever that a first lady
 has ever run for and now, apparently, won a Congressional seat. Quite a
 remarkable story.
