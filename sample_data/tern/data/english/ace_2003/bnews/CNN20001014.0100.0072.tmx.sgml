 the white house says it's operating under the assumption that terrorists are
 behind the attack.
 investigators say they're looking at a number of mideast groups in connection
 with the blast, but so far, none have claimed responsibility.
 more from jamie m intyre.
<TURN>
 the blast that punched this through the 1/2-inch thick steel hull of the
 destroyer "uss cole" was as unexpected as it was deadly.
<TURN>
 according to an eyewitness account, the explosion occurred when a small boat,
 that was participating in the mooring, approached the "uss cole."
<TURN>
 the american sailors caught in one of the main engine rooms and on the mess
 deck above it were killed by the powerful blast.
 and three dozen sailors were wounded in what the pentagon says appears to be a
 suicide terrorist attack.
 according to pentagon sources in a routine maneuver, the small boat helped
 attach a mooring line to a off-shore buoy.
 but then, with the boat close by the warship, the two men seemed to stand at
 attention as the boat exploded without warning.
<TURN>
 my view is that, and the scenario that i have described to you, is that it
 would be extraordinarily difficult to have ever observed in time to do anything
 about this kind of situation and to have stopped it.
<TURN>
 the destroyer "uss cole" was en route from the mediterranean sea to the persian
 gulf to take part in enforcement of the oil embargo against iraq.
 because of the terrorist groups known to operate in yemen, it used to be off
 limits to u.s. ships but the cole, which left its home port in norfolk,
 virginia, <TIMEX2 val="2000-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this summer</TIMEX2>, refueled there in part because of a u.s. policy aimed at
 improving relations with yemen.
 the warship was scheduled to be there for only <TIMEX2 val="PT4H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="article does not provide date of the attack">four</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="PT6H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">six hours</TIMEX2> meaning the
 attack had to be planned well ahead of time.
<TURN>
 given the magnitude of this blast, it couldn't have been put together in a
 garage <TIMEX2 val="P1NI" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">overnight</TIMEX2>.
 somebody had to do some careful planning to cause this much damage, this much
 loss of life and injury to our loved ones.
<TURN>
 the pentagon says it's premature to blame the attack on any particular group.
<TURN>
 if, however, we determine that terrorists attacked our ship and killed our
 sailors, then we will not rest until we have tracked down those who are
 responsible for this vicious and cowardly act.
<TURN>
 in response to the attack, the pentagon has put all of its forces around the
 world on a higher state of alert, but until the u.s. completes its
 investigation, the pentagon could offer no assurances this kind of attack
 couldn't happen again.
