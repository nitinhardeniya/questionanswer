 port of Aden have been killed. Eleven others are missing, and 35 were
 injured after an explosion. President Clinton says the US will act if the

 packed with explosives had rammed the USS Cole but it says a small raft was
 nearby. Reports from the scene say two men onboard the raft stood at
 attention just before the explosion.
