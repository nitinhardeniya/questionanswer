 Ivory Coast's army has pledged its loyalty to opposition candidate Loran
 Gbagbo. The pledge followed a tumultuous 24 hours that ended the rule of the
 Hunta, which seized power last December. Soldiers and civilians took to the
 streets to celebrate the departure of Hunta leader General Robert Guei. In
 an address on state television, Wednesday, Mr. Gbagbo, leader of the Ivorian
 Socialist party said he would be forming a cabinet shortly.
