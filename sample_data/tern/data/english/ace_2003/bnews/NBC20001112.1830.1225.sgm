 today this alpine resort town came to an abrupt halt as more than 150 victims
 were all but positively identified.
 friends and relatives who'd been waiting and hoping were taken to a private
 memorial service.
 up the mountain the usually packed ski areas were completely deserted.
 investigators still haven't figured out what caused this disaster.
 several eyewitnesses have told them they saw flames coming from the train as it
 headed up the mountain, before it entered the tunnel.
 one official here said, by the time the driver noticed the fire, it already was
 too late.
 the main concern now is to remove and identify the victims.
 these americans ended a holiday weekend burdened by a deep sense of loss.

 hard for this entire nation mourning the worst disaster here that anyone can
 remember.
