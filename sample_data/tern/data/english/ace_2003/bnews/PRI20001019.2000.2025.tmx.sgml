 Britain said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> that it is normalizing relations with North Korea. British
 Prime Minister Tony Blair called the decision a historic breakthrough. It comes
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">just days ahead of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip to the North
 Korean capital Pyongyang</TIMEX2>. Britain's foreign minister Robin Cook, who made the
 announcement, said opening diplomatic links could help ease tensions between
 North and South Korea, technically the two countries are still at war. Germany
 said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> that it also plans to normalize relations with Pyongyang, Celic

 DC. Mr. Harrison, Britain, Italy, prior to that Australia, the Philippines <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:33:45.41" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>
 and apparently Germany all bringing the most secretive state into the fold. How
 about the United States, where does that leave us?
<TURN>
 Well, I think President Clinton will get some good political cover. From what
 Britain has done, if he goes to Pyongyang, as is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:33:45.41" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> being discussed, Secretary
 Albright is going to go, the number two man in North Korea was in Washington
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>. Things are moving, what's particularly important is that Britain has
 not attached any conditions. The United States has imposed a number of
 conditions on normalizing with North Korea. The most important of them is that
 it renounce its missile program and its nuclear weapons program, or rather
 reach agreements on limiting and possibly ending them both, and as of <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:33:45.41" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> we
 are not in a position to normalize relations with North Korea just like that.
 We will want negotiations on some of these contested issues.
<TURN>
 Well let me ask you more about America's interest <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:33:45.41" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> and Britain's move, I
 mean how do you make sense of what's happening, especially if Britain was
 involved in a war with North Korea as obviously was the United States, and
 until <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:33:45.41" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> North Korea was considered by the US a rogue nation. It is still
 shrouded in secrecy, as we said, including in its nuclear weapons program. Are
 you trusting of these newly forced alliances, do you consider what Britain is
 doing either reckless or ill advanced?
<TURN>
 No. And I don't think it is an alliance really, it is just conducting
 diplomatic interchange with them. It is not even clear how soon Britain is
 going to have a mission in Pyongyang. And so I think it certainly isn't
 reckless to establish diplomatic relations, and I think indeed it is a very
 healthy thing because the present leadership of Kim Jong Il, son of the late
 General You  , he has been trying to open up to the outside world. He doesn't
 want to reform his internal economic system or political controls. On the other
 hand he needs western capital, he needs supportive international agencies to
 deal with tremendous economic problems that North Korea has had since the end
 of the cold war, when they lost their Russian and Chinese economic subsidies.
 So that trend of North Korea opening up to the outside, it seems to be, it
 should be encouraged.
<TURN>
 So then as North Korea opens up more and more, what are the possible
 repercussions down the road for the nearly 40,000 American troops who remain in
 South Korea?
<TURN>
 Well, North Korea's attitude has been that if the United States and North Korea
 are friends and the North Koreans don't feel threatened, they wont object to
 some US forces remaining in the Korean peninsula in a new role. That is to say,
 if they are going to be there as allies of South Korea against North Korea,
 then the North Koreans don't want them there, they will keep putting on the
 pressure for the US to get the forces out. The North Koreans are certainly not
 going to end their missile program, if the US continues to maintain some
 aspects of its military presence in the Korean peninsula such as its aircraft.
 So I think they are going to ask for military concessions in order to do what
 we want them to do regarding missiles, but I think that the assumption that
 this improvement in ties between North and South and between North Korea and
 other countries is going to lead to the complete withdrawal of the US from
 Korea in <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:33:45.41" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the near future</TIMEX2>, certainly I don't think at all, are.
<TURN>
 Mr. Harrison, thank you very much for speaking with us.
<TURN>
 Thank you.
