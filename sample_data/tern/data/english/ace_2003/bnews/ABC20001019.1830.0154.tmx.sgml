 mr. bush and his campaign have also decided on what they think is the key issue
 for <TIMEX2 val="P2.5W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="the context of the article makes today, and not this week, the clear starting date of this duration">the next 2 1/2 weeks</TIMEX2>.
 but he also would not yield to mr. gore on social security.
 here is abc's dean reynolds.
<TURN>
 defending his plan to reform social security, george w. bush launched a fierce
 counter-attack <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> against al gore.
<TURN>
 al gore leads the party of franklin delano roosevelt, but the only thing he has
 to offer is fear itself.
<TURN>
 criticism of bush's plan has mounted since <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tuesday night</TIMEX2>'s debate.
 and ever since the republican nominee has tried to assure voters his plan to
 privatize some of social security for younger workers will not come at the
 expense of the system as a whole.
 to argue otherwise, bush said ofore, is irresponsible.
<TURN>
 a true leader does not try to pit grandparents against grandchildren.
<TURN>
 bushes message in <TIMEX2 val="P19D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="coreferential with '19 days before the election'">the waning days of the campaign</TIMEX2> is vintage gop, calling gore
 a big spending, big government liberal in the mold of walter mondale opposite.
<TURN>
 he wants the government to control your lives.
 we want you to control your lives.
<TURN>
 yes, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T18:32:34.15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> administration has presided over <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">years of prosperity</TIMEX2>, but bush
 says i deserves none of the credit.
<TURN>
 the economic growth of <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T18:32:34.15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">today</TIMEX2> has occurred because of ingenuity and hard work,
 but it sure helped to have ronald reagan tax cuts provide more capital in the
 private sector for small businesses to use.
<TURN>
 this kind of language may conflict with bush's compassionate image.
 it may inflame the opposition and undermine his repeated calls for an end to
 partisan bickering.
 with <TIMEX2 val="P19D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">19 days before the election</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the time for making news</TIMEX2> is over.
