 This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins.
 Putting aside <TIMEX2 val="P.5CE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">a half century of acrimony</TIMEX2>, Secretary of State, Madeleine
 Albright met <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang. Part
 of the purpose of this historic visit is to lay the groundwork for a possible
 trip to North Korea by President Clinton before his term ends. Albright's visit
 to Pyongyang is the first by a high level US official since the communist state
 was established in <TIMEX2 val="1948" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1948</TIMEX2>. Kong Dan O is a Korean expert who has just written a
 book called 'North Korea through the Looking Glass'. She is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T20:20:52.55" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> in the South
 Korean capital of Seoul. We know that the visit is making big news there in
 Seoul. Can you tell us what is being reported about the meeting between the two
 sides from the South Korean perspective?
<TURN>
 Well, when I look at about six major <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">daily</TIMEX2> newspapers, basically the top news
 was Madeleine Albright meeting with the Chairman Kim Jong Il. And basically
 that indeed this is a very historic event, and some kind of euphoria and very
 positive upbeat feeling. But at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the same time</TIMEX2>, the reports are basically
 telling the importance of this meeting that is that they have to talk about the
 very critical security matter issues such as missile and nuke. But nonetheless,
 the meeting was very crucial, so I think all in all, it was a very positive
 beginning.
<TURN>
 And how much of South Korea as you mentioned is bordering on euphoria, get this
 new relationship with Pyongyang and at the visit by Secretary of State
 Albright? I know that you have taken a more cautious approach, and I wonder if
 that applies to Secretary Albright's visit in general? Do you believe that the
 US is doing the right thing? Or is perhaps the United States, in your view,
 moving too quickly to try and patch things up?
<TURN>
 I am kind of taking a slightly cautious approach, simply because if Madam
 Albright is there, without the really thinking down the road some kind of
 strategic consequences of this meeting, simply because we are interested in
 seeing this gentleman and maybe before our term is over, let me meet you. I
 think that kind of simple approach to be wrong. But if she understands
 importance of this meeting and further brings up substance of issue to be
 resolved between the North Korea and the United States, I think that is very
 desirable.
<TURN>
 What you're saying is that you feel that the part of the impetus of the North
 is influenced by the fact that the United States has a presidential election
 <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W43" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">just a couple of weeks away</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 I think that is a definitely correct statement, provided that maybe the
 Republican candidate, Mr. Bush to be elected. North Korea was very, very scared
 that Mr. Bush would take a much more hawkish and conservative approach. So
 before this Clinton administration comes to be over, they would like to lay
 down the ground rules and kind of create some kind of positive improvement to
 deal with the United States. And obviously one of the most important agendas
 for <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2> is to discuss the possibilities of President Clinton's next visit
 <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">sometime in <TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">November</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 I know that you have concerns about how a potential visit by President Clinton
 might be portrayed within North Korea itself. Why is that a concern of yours?
<TURN>
 My fundamental belief is that Kim Jong Il has not really made his mind or
 made a decision to push the reforms, even in the session of <TIMEX2 val="1978" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1978</TIMEX2> Chinese Reform
 that was taken by Dun Sha Pin. He is now gambling, he is trying, but he has not
 really changed his manner or his policy whatsoever. His economy and his
 society's politics is really getting in real deep trouble. He has to show his
 power and he's been telling his people that I am the true leader and the world
 is afraid of us. All the imperialist capitalist is afraid of us. That we are
 the center of the universe. Without the North Korea, the globe is not existing.
 Let me show you that I am the true leader and they will come to our country to
 pay visit, courtesy visit for me. And so <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T20:20:52.55" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> Putin visited, President Kim
 visited, Jiang Zemin will visit <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2> and the President Clinton will go.
 Domestic consumption of this visit will be immense, without changing any policy
 toward the freedom of proliferation  .
<TURN>
 Is it really possible with the kind of close watch that the outside world is
 <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-23T20:20:52.55" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> going to be invited to give to North Korea, that Kim Jong Il could
 actually not change a thing in terms of his policies, internally or externally?
<TURN>
 I am exactly wondering like you, and I think that there is a maybe the
 possibility actually is going up. So I don't object really any of these like
 U.K. normalization, you know. I don't have any objection. But only when the
 leaders and the elite, the policy elite, is aware of that what they are
 bringing and what they are negotiating and how they would like to have an
 impact on North Korean society, I think that's the important key question.
<TURN>
 Kong Dan O is the author of the book 'North Korea through the Looking Glass',
 speaking to us from Seoul, South Korea. Thank you very much.
<TURN>
 Thank you.
