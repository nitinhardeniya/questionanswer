 A Moscow court has denied a request by US spy suspect Edmund Pope for a
 medical examination, despite his rare bone cancer. Mr. Pope's condition has
 gone untreated since he was jailed five months ago. Russia accuses the
 former US naval intelligence officer of illegally obtaining secrets about a
 high-tech Russian torpedo. On Friday the court denied a series of defense
 motions that also included a request to tape the proceedings and replace the
 court translator, who works for Russian security. The trial opened
 Wednesday and has been suspended until Monday.
