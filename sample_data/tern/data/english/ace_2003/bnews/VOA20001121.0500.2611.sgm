 British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrives in Russia today for talks with
 Vladimir Putin on security, foreign policy, and economic issues. They are
 also expected to discuss a new Russian proposal for deep cuts in US and
 Russian long-range missiles. VOA's Larry James in Moscow.

 The highlight of the one-day visit will be three hours of talks on Tuesday,
 during which Mr. Blair and Mr. Putin will focus on a wide range of issues
 including Russia's latest call for cutting the number of strategic nuclear
 warheads to below 1500. President Clinton has said such a deal is possible,
 but that it will be first necessary to convince Moscow of the merits of
 America's proposed Missile Defense System. The US wants to amend the 1972
 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so it can develop such a system. Russia
 believes such a move could spark a new arms race and has threatened to tear
 up existing weapons agreements and stop disarmament talks if the United
 States goes ahead. On Sunday Mr. Putin called on the Russian parliament to
 quickly ratify the amended Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. That
 treaty requires Russia to make further non-nuclear weapons reductions in
 some areas of the country including breakaway Chechnya. President Putin
 acknowledged that Russia is still violating its commitment in Chechnya, but
 he said it is only a temporary situation which has the ultimate aim of
 cutting armaments in the region. He also thanked the 29 other signatories
 to the treaty for their understanding. He said Russia is fully behind the
 agreement that, he said, is an efficient instrument of ensuring security in
 Europe for years to come. The original treaty was signed in 1990 and led to
 the destruction of thousands of heavy weapons by NATO and the former Warsaw
 Pact. Tony Blair became the first western leader to come to Russia to meet
 the new President last March even before Mr. Putin was elected. The Russian
 leader returned the favor by making London one of his first foreign
 destinations after taking office. The two have already met four times this
 year. Analysts here in Moscow believe Britain can play a useful role as a
 bridge to both Europe and the United States. Trade is also expected to
 figure significantly in the talks. Britain ranks as the third largest
 investor after the United States and Germany with just slightly more than $1
 billion invested in Russia. Larry James, VOA News, Moscow.
