 In South Asia, authorities in Bangladesh's Southwestern port of Mongla have
 called on the army to control riots that have left at least four people dead
 and 58 injured. Officials say the trouble began when striking dock workers
 tried to storm the port authority offices and police fired to disperse them.
 The demonstrators are demanding that more people be hired to load and
 unload goods at the port.
