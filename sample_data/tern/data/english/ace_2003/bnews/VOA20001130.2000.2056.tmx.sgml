 More than 50 people are dead in Nigeria, after a leaking oil pipeline burst
 into flames outside the commercial capital, Lagos. The blast and resulting
 fire <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, ripped through an area near a fuel-loading depot owned by the
 state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Witnesses report seeing
 burnt bodies littering the charred grounds while many other victims are
 being treated for injuries sustained in the blaze. A spokeswoman for the
 Petroleum Company says the fire was caused by vandals.
