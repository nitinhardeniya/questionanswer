the following a grim story out ofussia tonight where 
there's proof some of the sailors on board that russian 
nuclear submarine the kursk initially survived the 
explosion that sank the sub, only to be trapped later. 
one of the sailors wrote a letter during those terrible 
final hours.
<TURN>
 today, 10 weeks after a mysterious accident sent the 
kursk to the bottom of the barents see, a grisly 
discovery. in the pocket of one of the 
crew, a handwritten note, dying words of a sailor trapped alive 
in the sunken sub. he is this lieutenant captain, 
seen here three years ago aboard the kursk. 
his last words tell a chilling tail -- tale of a desperate but 
future ill attempt toscape. it now appears 23 survived -- 
survived the initial explosion. the 23 frantically scrambled to 
the rear of the sub. they find thescape hatch 
flooded and seal themselves in compartment nine. 
realizing he will die, he begins to write.

he addressed the letter to his wife, olga.
<TURN>
he is my dear, dea beloved. i want to see him again, read 
his letter.

 the chilling account raises new questions and criticisms of 
the russian navy, which waited several days before attempting 
to launch any rescue mission but navy officials here at the 
pentagon say any rescue attempt would have failed, that there 
really was no hope for the 23 survivors. 
it's believed they would have frozen to death in hours, long 
before they ran out of air. that may be little consolation 
for the families. nbc news correspondent jim 
miklaszweski, the pentagon.

program note here. coming up tonight at 10:00 p.m. 
eastern, a closer look at the kursk and similar disasters 
that have taken place at sea.
