 The Chads are hanging <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> in South Africa. Citizens there are casting
 their ballots in Municipal elections, but they are voting on national
 issues. Many South Africans are disillusioned over corruption and the
 failure of the government to deliver on its promises of jobs, housing and
 health care. <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Today</TIMEX2>'s vote could be seen as a referendum on the performance
 of the African National Congress, the party of South African icon Nelson
 Mandela and of President Thabo Mbeki. Mondy Makania is Political Editor of
 the Johannesburg Sunday Times. Mr. Makania, who is the opposition
 politically to the ANC and to Mr. Mbeki in these Municipal elections?
<TURN>
 The main opposition is the Democratic Alliance which is basically a party
 which was formed out of a merger between the old National Party which
 governed the country during <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the apartheid era</TIMEX2> and the Democratic Party which
 was the more liberal opposition during <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the apartheid era</TIMEX2>. But those two
 parties are seen to represent the white community and they have been very
 vocal about issues affecting the white community. But <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-05T20:10:20.51" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> they are starting
 to reach out to the black communities, starting to raise issues which affect
 the black community. And they are hoping that in these elections, this new
 alliance will be able to   the very racially defined voting
 patterns that have characterized South African politics since <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>, when we
 had our first elections. And indications are that they might get a very
 minute portion of the black vote, but it will not be significant. Black
 people, those who are going to vote will vote for the African National
 Congress and those who are disenchanted with the ANC will stay at home
 rather than vote for a dominantly white party.
<TURN>
 The old members of the National party, the so-called 'Natzs', I would assume
 that in order to be successful, have to make an appeal to black voters. At
 some point, they've got to get them to turn their disenchantment with the
 ANC into a willingness to vote for the new party. What kind of appeal are
 they going to be making to black voters?
<TURN>
 Well, in this party election campaign, what they have been saying is that
 the ANC is a party which only looks after the cronies and the friends and
 the relatives of their ruling elite. And they have been saying that the ANC
 is not dealing with issues such as AIDS, which is affecting a lot of black
 communities at the moment and they have been saying that the ANC is not
 dealing with the issues of crime. Those are very common issues which run
 across racial lines and they are basically telling black people that "look
 we care about these issues, we care about the decline in health services and
 we are going to fix it." And also, there are also issues of conservatism.
 Basically the black population is generally quite conservative and since the
 ANC came in, issues like abortion and homosexuality and all that have been
 constitutionally recognized and they have been legalized. And that's an
 issue that makes a lot of African people very uncomfortable and those
 parties are appealing to that and saying that, look this government is
 basically doing things that are supposedly which you could characterize as
 un-African and un-Christian. So I mean like there is a lot of that sort of
 like below the line appeal that they are trying to get across to black
 people.
<TURN>
 Mr. Makania this is really fascinating. I mean looking at South Africa and
 also looking locally at the politics of your own city Johannesburg, are you
 seeing something that in a sense is like a fundamental redrafting of the
 politics of South Africa here?
<TURN>
 Not in the very short term. I think there is a beginning of that. The ANC
 is still very dominant and it's going to be dominant for <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">10</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">20 years to
 come</TIMEX2>. Because I mean, black people still have that liberation appeal. It's
 still there in the ANC. It is a party of Nelson Mandela. But I think the
 more apartheid recede from the psyche and the more people forget about what
 used to be, and the more people forget about who liberated them, I think
 you'll start to get that breaking down of the lock'em in racial politic in
 the country. But I mean slowly, slowly I think it will start to happen. As
 I said in this election, the Democratic Alliance, for instance, invested a
 lot of money, a lot of resources into getting the black vote and they know
 they are not going to get much of it. But they tell themselves that they
 are investing in <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-05T20:10:20.51" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the future</TIMEX2>, that come <TIMEX2 val="2005" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">5</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="2010" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">10 years down the line</TIMEX2>, they will
 be able to grab a lot more because <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-05T20:10:20.51" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> they have a presence. People will
 recognize them.
<TURN>
 Mr. Makania, on my desk I have a copy of that wonderful book 'South African
 English, Dictionary, South African English.' I haven't had a chance to
 check it <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, but I am wondering if the word 'Chad' is in it. Do you have
 Chads in South Africa?
<TURN>
 No, Chad only exists in a country in Central Africa. No, Chad only got into
 the national land which in <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W49" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past few weeks</TIMEX2>, because we still vote
 according to the old, kind of like we make an 'X' when we vote. So
 fragmented and triple Chads do not exist in this part of the world.
<TURN>
 Well, Mr. Makania, we wish you a safe and Chadless election.
<TURN>
 Thank you. Now look, we are going to have our results by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of
 tomorrow</TIMEX2>. Everything will be there and they will be declared and there will
 be no court cases after <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 Mondy Makania is Political Editor of the Johannesburg Sunday Times. Thank
 you very much, Mr. Makania.
<TURN>
 Thank you.
