 we have been here so many times before the threat
 of a wider war in the middle east.
 there has been impressive progress
 but a lasting past remains elusivusive.
 president  clinton
 today considered
 flying to the middle east for
 an emergency summit meeting, but he backed away.
 how did it come to this so swiftly?
 here's andrea mitchell.

<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 the president returns to washington today,
 hoping to salvage something from eight years of middle east
 diplomacy. what went wrong?
 to many peace seemed so close at camp david in july.
 how did it all fall apart? first, palestinian resentment.
 on the street, people see no economic rewards, aren't any
 better off after years of peace talks, and they resent the u.s.
 for blaming arafat when the summit collapses while
 praising israel's prime minister barak.
<TURN>
 the prime minister moved forward more from his initial
 position than chairman arafat, particularly surrounding
 the questions of jerusalem. 
<TURN>
 it's quite clear the palestinians do not accept
 the various proposals put forward to divide jerusalem.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 arafat appears weak, and radical groups like
 hamas gain strength. 
<TURN>
 a weakened arafat emboldens a great deal of forces that does
 not want peace. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 second, israeli frustration.
 many israelis feel barak goes too far by offering arafat
 partial control of the holy sites, gets nothing in return.
<TURN>
 i think barak was very forthcoming at camp david.
 the intransigence or failure of arafat to come forward
 with any counterproposal i think frustrated the prime minister
 and frustrated the israelis. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 finally, the summit raises false hopes, is not well
 prepared by washington. the u.s. rushes ahead, eager
 for a breakthrough before the end of clinton's term.
 other arab leaders like mubarak of egypt and fahd
 of saudi arabia are not sold on the deal, tell arafat
 to hold out. 
<TURN>
 if a concerted effort was put together to consult with these
 people and bring them on board, then probably arafat would have
 been able to cut a deal. 
<TURN>
  i
 think  the united states did
 not prepare adequately
 for camp david. they should have been much more
 careful in the preparation and more assured of getting some
 kind of an agreement. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 with most observers saying that camp david only made
 a bad situation worse, questions tonight as to why the president
 would even consider going to another summit with even less
 hope of a solution. washington.
