 Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffi can be prosecuted in France over the bombing of a
 French airliner in which a 170 people were killed. That's the ruling of a court
 in Paris. It rejected an appeal that as a serving head of state Gadaffi should
 be immune from prosecution. The lawyer representing the victims' families
 Fransvas Rudutski is hailing the decision as a victory.
<TURN>
 The victory today is that any people who committed an act of terrorism should
 know that he can be pursued and could be arrested and there is no immunity for
 anyone, any leaders in the world.
<TURN>
 Relatives of those killed after an explosion on board the plane over Neijer in
 1989, brought the case against the Libyan leader. Six Libyans including Colonel
 Gadaffi's brother-in-law have already been tried in their absence.
