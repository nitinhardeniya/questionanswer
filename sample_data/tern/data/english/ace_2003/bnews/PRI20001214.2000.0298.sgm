 Edmund Pope tasted freedom today for the first time in more than eight
 months. Pope is the American businessman who was convicted last week on
 spying charges and sentenced to 20 years in a Russian prison. He denied any
 wrongdoing. Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned him for health
 reasons. Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany. He
 will spend the next several days at the medical center there before he
 returns home with his wife Sherry. Pope was in remission from a rare form
 of bone cancer when he was arrested in Russia. Doctors will examine him for
 signs that the cancer may have come back while he awaiting trial in a
 Russian jail. A spokeswoman said that Pope was suffering from malnutrition
 and high blood pressure.
