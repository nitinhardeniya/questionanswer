 with the presidential debate <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> in st. louis,
 the candidates will be in the middle of a hot political
 issue that's not getting much national attention --
 what to do about the missouri river, the fabled waterway
 of lewis and clark that joins the mississippi in st. louis.
 it's a far different river <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-17T18:54:34.50" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> than it <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-17T18:54:34.50" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">once</TIMEX2> was,
 and the question is -- should it be allowed to return
 to its true form? nbc's national correspondent
 is jim avila.

 the wide missouri, pioneers called it  --
 too thick to drink, too thin to plow.
 a shallow, slow moving, swampy river that birds and fish loved
 in its natural state. 
<TURN>
 the ebb and flow in a river like the missouri provides
 the basis for life itself. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 but the missouri is no longer wild, tamed by dams
 and dredging. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-17T18:54:34.50" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> a shipping highway
 the government says endangers the very existence of three
 critical river species -- the <TIMEX2 val="P100000000Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">100 million-year-old</TIMEX2> pallid
 sturgeon, the shore-wading the least tern.
 the missouri's natural rhythm destroyed, say the experts,
 by six dams in a system from north central montana
 to the mississippi river. a transformation turning
 the meandering river into essentially a deep water
 ditch. 
<TURN>
 without providing the higher flow in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SP" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the spring</TIMEX2> and the lower
 flow in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SU" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the summer</TIMEX2> that missouri river species are adapted to,
 they're going to disappear. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-17T18:54:34.50" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s sturgeon can't reproduce
 in the river any more, only in man-made hatcheries and sand
 bars, homes to wading birds are being
 washed away by deep water. so to save fish and birds
 and improve recreational use in up-river states, where
 tourism is a major source of income,
 the government wants to alter <TIMEX2 val="P50Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">50 years of steady water flow</TIMEX2>.
 re-creating the original river by releasing more water
 in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SP" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">spring</TIMEX2>, less in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SU" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">summer</TIMEX2> -- fighting words for downriver
 farmers and barge operators. 
<TURN>
 try explaining that times have changed, nonsense
 to the people who live along the missouri river and don't
 want to go back to the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SP" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">spring</TIMEX2> floods.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 it's about the water and who controls
 it. the missouri, second longest
 river in the country. 7 states, 2,500 miles long
 and <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-17T18:54:34.50" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> according to conservationists, second
 on the list of rivers in danger. farmers say it's <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the planting
 season</TIMEX2> that's in danger if the missouri isn't controlled
 in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SP" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">spring</TIMEX2>. and barge owners say <TIMEX2 val="P2M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="XXXX-SU" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">two dry
 months in <TIMEX2 val="P1SU" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the summer</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> will ruin business.
<TURN>
 what this proposal does is double the cost of operation
 on the missouri river and will cause those companies to move
 off the river. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 but according to
 figures  from the u.s. corps
 of army engineers, the four grain producing states
 along the missouri, producing nearly 5 billion bushels
 of grain <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">each year</TIMEX2>, ship very little by barge now.
 16.7 million bushels. that's .3%.
<TURN>
 the barge companies do not own the missouri river.
 the flood plain farmers do not own the missouri river.
 everybody owns it. we have to find a way to share
 the missouri. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 and say environmentalists save three
 threatened  species and a leisure
 economy dependent upon a wide, untamed missouri.
