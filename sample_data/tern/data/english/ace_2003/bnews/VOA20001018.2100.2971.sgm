 And on we go to check our facts and figures on the business page. The major
 stock averages on Wall Street plunged sharply early Wednesday after some
 negative corporate earnings news. The market recovered lost ground during
 the day, but still ended with losses. VOA's Elaine Johanneson has a report
 for us from New York.

 After dropping over 400 points in early trading, the DOW Jones industrial
 average closed about 115 points or 1% lower at 9975. It was the DOW's first
 close below 10,000 since last March. The S&AMP;P 500 index fell eight points.
 Meanwhile, the technology-weighted NASDAQ composite, after plunging nearly 6
 percent, cut its loss to just over 1 percent. The blue chips came under
 pressure after the world's biggest computer maker IBM said earnings were on
 target, but third quarter sales were disappointing. IBM stock plunged 15
 percent. Also number two US bank Chase Manhattan said, losses on its
 technology investments cut deeply into its quarterly results. After all the
 slipping and sliding of recent weeks, analysts are still not sure the market
 is ready to climb back. Elaine Johanneson, VOA News, New York.
