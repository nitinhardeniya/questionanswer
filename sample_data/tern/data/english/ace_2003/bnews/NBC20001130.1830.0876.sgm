 nbc news "in depth" tonight -- another down day on wall street n today.
 technology stocks touching new lows for the year, and the blue chips also down
 sharply, n everyone worrying about corporate profits.
 at one point it dropped to less than 50% of its closing high for the year, last
 march.
 to begin our "in depth" reporting tonight with nbc's chief financial
 correspondent mike jensen on the floor of the nasdaq.
<TURN>
 this was a scary day on wall street.
 wave after wave of selling all day long and very few buyers.
 the dow plunges a stunning 336 points by midafternoon.
 the nasdaq down 183, partly because of profit worries at a handful of high-tech
 companies.
<TURN>
 over half the drop in the dow 30 today is due to four technology stocks --
 hewlett packard, intel, ibm and microsoft.
<TURN>
 what about the other half of the plunge?
 analysts say it's uncertainty over not only earnings, but the economy and the
 election -- investors bewildered.
<TURN>
 the market's been killing me since march.
<TURN>
 i'm not investing any new money.
<TURN>
 so what should small investors do now?
<TURN>
 i believe this is close to the blowoff event, and that we'll see stocks
 significantly higher a year from now.
<TURN>
 analysts say there are bargains, but be very careful and very selective.
<TURN>
 financial stocks, health care stocks, consumer nondurables, industrial stocks
 are all acting rather well right now.
<TURN>
 by the end of trading today, the market did recover about a third of its
 losses.
 still, with so many stocks plunging -- the dow down 11% from its high of the
 year, nasdaq down 49% -- most investors are waiting to see what comes next.
 one big question mark -- will the federal reserve cut interest rates to get the
 economy going and help the stock market?
 the next fed meeting is december
 tom?
 tom?
<TURN>
 thanks very much, mike jensen tonight.
