 A court in Moscow today sentenced American businessman Edmund Pope to 20
 years in jail. Pope, a former naval officer, was found guilty of collecting
 secret blueprints for a high speed Russian torpedo. Pope denied the charges
 and he had a powerful ally. President Clinton had appealed for clemency for
 Pope on health grounds and had brought the case up with Russian President
 Vladimir Putin, but Mr. Clinton's pleas apparently fell on deaf ears. The
 Russian court today handed down the maximum sentence. Still, The World's
 Nenad Chebeck in Moscow says that Pope has not yet exhausted his legal
 options.
<TURN>
 He has got 7 days to appeal this particular sentence. There is also the
 possibility of asking for a presidential pardon, Pope has actually indeed
 already done that. It's just that his wife said that she has not heard
 neither from the President nor his office.
<TURN>
 His health is a big issue as well, isn't it?
<TURN>
 Yes, Pope has been suffering from a rare bone cancer in the past and he has
 been consistently complaining about his health ever since last Spring when
 he was taken in to the Lefortovo prison. The thing is that he has not been
 allowed any access to American doctors and even to Russian doctors of his
 own choosing. He has been examined by the Russian doctors in the Lefortovo
 prison but they have just said that his complaints are unfounded and that it
 might be a case of severe rheumatism or something like that. They are not
 sort of allowing the possibility of his bone cancer reoccurring.
<TURN>
 One of the things that has been said here is that Mr. Pope may have run
 afoul of a changing mood in Russia about what kind of military and security
 information might be made available to the west for business purposes. That
 his intentions were innocent to begin with, but the times changed and what
 he did began to look more and more like espionage.
<TURN>
 That is certainly a possibility but we don't know actually precisely because
 we don't even know what the initial charges are. The whole trial was held
 behind closed doors and the details of the accusations against Pope have
 never been fully released. We know that the prosecution claimed that he was
 trying to purchase secret plans for a top-secret high-speed Russian torpedo.
 He was claiming all the time, and his lawyer was saying that he was sort of
 trying to purchase plans that had been actually out in the open but we do
 not know the precise legals of that. That is one of the possibilities.
 Another thing which is mentioned here is that Pope simply ran afoul of a new
 trend in Russia which was a trend where the security services were getting
 the upper hand where they were trying to prove that they are actually doing
 their job, that they are catching spies, that they are getting convictions.
 We have, for example, today's reaction by General Alexander Danewich, he is
 the head of the FSB support programs. He was very, very brief in his
 comments after the sentencing. He said that the court has said that FSB
 investigators have acted correctly and in accordance with the law and he
 says, "Russia has its secrets, we will do our best to protect them". May be
 Pope simply ran afoul of such attempts by the Russian Security Services to
 show that they are doing their job.
<TURN>
 Putin, on the one hand, is certainly trying to show that he is in charge and
 that no one from the outside is going to get away with anything. By the same
 token though he is not eager to run afoul of the United States and the State
 Department is very upset. Is there any possibility that Mr. Putin might
 consider a pardon?
<TURN>
 I would say there is a very strong possibility of that. We know that
 President Clinton has spoken to Vladimir Putin about this when they met last
 time, and certainly the Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has brought up
 the issue a number of times, as has the State Department indeed with the
 Russian Foreign Ministry. In a curious way the sentencing of Edmund Pope
 might be the beginning of an end of this ordeal for him. Because now that
 there is a sentence, once the judiciary process is started, once the FSB
 brought him to trial everybody here expected that the trial will end and
 that it will end with a conviction. But now that this judicial process is
 over there is a very, very strong likelihood, that's the feeling here in
 Moscow that President Vladimir Putin might pardon Edmund Pope. There is a
 good reason for that, his ill health. So it would be a nice humanitarian
 gesture and a way of offering a friendly hand to the west and to the United
 States in particular.
<TURN>
 The World's Nenad Sebek in Moscow. Thanks a lot, Nenad.
<TURN>
 You are welcome.
