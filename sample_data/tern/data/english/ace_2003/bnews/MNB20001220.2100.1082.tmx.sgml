more <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-20T21:18:02.02" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> on the previously mentioned, largely faith-based 
gathering <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, featuring the president-elect in texas. 
the number of black ministers at <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s meeting in austin, was 
no accident. it is part of a concerted 
outreach effort by the president-elect to try to get a 
huge part of the population that did not support him on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">election 
day</TIMEX2>, to support him <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-20T21:18:02.02" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>. george w. bush received only 8% 
of the black vote in america. that's less than bob dole got in 
<TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>. that's less than president bush 
got in <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2>. for more on this topic and 
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s meeting with religious leaders, we are joined <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this 
evening</TIMEX2> by reverend james forbes, senior minister of the 
river side church. and from austin, marvin alaske, 
author of "compassionate conservative" and we might add 
the coiner of the phrase who was at the meeting <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this afternoon</TIMEX2>. 
welcome to you both. i guess, reverend foshes, i'd 
like to begin with you. let's talk about the african 
american voter dynamic in this country. 
why not more support for george w. bush, who made as a 
cornerstone of his campaign, reaching out, getting together?
<TURN>
i believe that it is possible that the turnout in regards to 
black support reflects a kind of perspective that raises 
questions as to whether or not that can really -- there can 
really be trust in the republican party. 
and also an expression of the way in which, in the democratic 
party, at least during the last administration, there was a 
strong sense of identification. so, now the issue has to be 
whether president-elect bush will be able, through his 
actions, both symbolic and substantive, to show that <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="this doesn't really mean day, it means time. Hard to tell if this should be interpreted as PRESENT_REF or not.">that 
day in which blacks were considered excluded, or in which 
they excluded themselves because they had no trust</TIMEX2>, that <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that day</TIMEX2> 
must end. and it is going to be up to him 
to be able to show that he is a genuine healer. 
that means being able to look at our wounds and understand our 
protests and be willing to move towards a kind of bridging of 
the gap. and, of course, we, too, have to 
stand ready, even to be surprised to discover that there 
may be a genuine opportunity here to approach <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="they really mean starting in 2001, but this would take world knowledge to get">the next four 
years</TIMEX2> with a sense of partnership rather than with a 
sense of division.
<TURN>
so, reverend, standing ready to be surprised indicates that 
he'll be talking, perhaps to a receptive audience?
<TURN>
i believe that we are always receptive, even though there are 
still some lingering doubts born of the nature of the campaign, 
the election. there are doubts. 
but i believe black religious leaders are experts in seeking 
hope, even in places you had not anticipated. 
so, i think we're going to be very serious. 
there's no time for foolishness in this thing. 
we're going to listen and then respond and then we're going to 
wait to see whether what we've got is promises or whether there 
is really the building of a new consensus.
<TURN>
i heard a commentator <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-19TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last night</TIMEX2> on cable television say 
that if the democrats had put diverse as this bush cabinet so 
far, containing a lot of firsts, we would never hear the end of 
it in this gentleman's words. what is the message from george 
w. bush on this topic?
<TURN>
well, the message is that there are lots of 
extraordinarily accomplished people who are there and want to 
serve in the administration and president-elect bush is reaching 
out to them. i should point out that in <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>, 
when he ran for governor of texas the first time, he 
received about 8% of the african american vote. 
when he ran <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four years later</TIMEX2>, he received about 30%. 
that's what happened here in texas. 
i suspect that will happen in the country as a whole and a lot 
will be surprised.
<TURN>
you're saying it's a matter of people getting to know him.
<TURN>
and also seeing the reality behind what he's been talking 
about. compassionate conservative was 
denigrated by some commentators as a little phrase for political 
purposes. over <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="they really mean starting in 2001, but it would take world knowledge to get this">the next four years</TIMEX2>, people 
will see the reality, beginning with the meeting he had <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> 
with inner city pastors and people who want faith-based 
groups, that wonderful term, to become more involved in solving 
poverty problems.
<TURN>
and when people hear that wonderful term, some people, 
especially those who are used to a large government role in their 
lives and in urban centers, get a little spooked by it. 
they worry that something untoward is happening. 
define for us, if you will, president-elect bush's view of a 
faith-based alternative.
<TURN>
 well, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-20T21:18:02.02" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2>, there tend to be only two alternatives from 
many individuals. either you rely on yourself or 
you rely on government. and that's happened over <TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the 
past 30 years</TIMEX2>. that has been a shift. 
earlier in american history, commentators visited us from 
abroad, like the french journalist, would always took 
about the porges of the groups that function as mediating 
structures between the individual and the government, 
able to do a lot of the social help that government can 
provide, but without building a big bureaucracy as government 
tents to do. that's been the strength of 
america. we've lost a lot of that over 
<TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last 30 years</TIMEX2>. the challenge is to whether we 
can regain that.
<TURN>
there are certain services, especially in america's great 
cities, where it has to be said if churches didn't do it, no one 
else would. you're intimately familiar with 
this. is this what the governor is 
talking about, do you think?
<TURN>
i believe that the present conversation sounds like 
shifting the weight to the churches. 
i believe a more mature perspective is learning a new 
pattern of partnerships. the churches have always tried 
to do itself, but they cannot amass the resources, nor sustain 
bureaucracies or institutions that can get it done alone. 
so, if the conversation is about, listen, you church 
organizations, mosques, and synagogues, do your part and we 
will do the aspect of repair in communities that requires 
governmental resources. we don't like the dividing up so 
that it's only one side. bring them together, then 
there's some prospect that we will achieve our goal.
<TURN>
reverend james forbes, again, is the senior minister of the 
riverside church, which is a beautiful place <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-20T21:18:02.02" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">this time of 
year</TIMEX2>. and dr. marvin olaske, the 
author of "compassionate conservative" and an advisor to 
the president-elect. gentlemen, interesting 
discussion <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>. thank you.
<TURN>
thank you.
