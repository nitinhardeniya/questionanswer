 we begin with warnings from the pentagon about possible terrorist activity in
 the gulf.
 defense officials say the pentagon has learned of a specific, credible threat
 against u.s. citizens and facilities in bahrain and qatar.
 u.s. forces in those nations are on their highest state of alert, known as
 threat condition delta.
 it is normally reserved for situations where an attack is believed imminent.
 the threat is believed to be linked to associates of alleged terrorist leader
 osama bin laden.
 officials say u.s. forces in turkey are at the second-highest state of alert,
 but for different reasons.
 bin laden's supporters are among the suspects in this month's attack on the
 "u.s.s. cole" in yemen.
 the cole investigation and the new terrorist threat will be on the agenda today
 as senior clinton administration officials meet on national security and
 defense matters.
