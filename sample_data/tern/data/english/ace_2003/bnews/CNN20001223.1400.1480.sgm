 toys are a serious business in one town in eastern germany, especially around
 this time of year.
 chris burns reports.
<TURN>
 in the middle ages, the town of seiffen was known for its mining industry.
 but as many mining towns have found out, the rich veins in the rocks weren't
 forever.
 so in a late example of radical economic restructuring, the miners had to turn
 to another source of livelihood.
<TURN>
 once that industry came to an end, people looked for different sources of
 income.
 in 16 for the first time, it showed toys at a fair.
 over the decades and centuries, the mining industry died down and at tension
 focused on toys.
<TURN>
 so they dropped their shovels, and away they went -- cutting, sawing,
 assembling, sanding, painting.
 no marketing survey needed then.
 kids will be kids, and christmas comes every year.
 the business has staying power.
 despite all the high-tech video games on the market, the christmas pyramid is
 still a hit.
 you can dress it up with candles.
 nutcrackers are also popular, wrought with the hands of the miners'
 descendants.
 candle holders come in various forms or with a tribute to seiffen's ancestors.
 this town of 3,000 fell under communist rule after the second world war, and

<TURN>
 until 1972, mostly toys were troughed and then under socialist rule, focus was
 played more and more on arts and crafts because it turned out to be an export
 hit.
 we took over and realized that these products are still popular.
<TURN>
 and they've gone a few steps further -- selling factory-to-you, and hawking on
 the internet.
 but if the salesmanship has become more sophisticated, the craftsmanship is
 pretty much like it was hundreds of years ago, with a few variations.
