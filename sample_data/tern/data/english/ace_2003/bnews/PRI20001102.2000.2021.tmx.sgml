 This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World service, PRI and WGBH in
 Boston. I'm Lisa Mullins.
 American spy suspect Edmund Pope took the stand again <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> in a Moscow
 courtroom. The <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02T20:33:41.53" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> naval intelligence officer faces charges of stealing
 secret designs for a high-speed Russian torpedo system. Pope denies acting
 illegally and President Clinton and Secretary Of State Madeleine Albright
 have called for his release on health grounds but Russian prosecutors are
 pressing ahead as The World's Nened Chebeck reports from Moscow.
<TURN>
 The trial was suspended <TIMEX2 val="2000-W44" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier in the week</TIMEX2> because of Pope's poor health.
 Pope has a history of bone cancer but a doctor working for the FSB, the
 Russian security service, pronounced Pope fit enough to stand trial <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>.
 The proceedings are held behind closed doors and Pope's lawyer said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>
 that his client is still very weak and that he wants a new interpreter, says
 the current one works for the same agency that has charged Pope. The lawyer
 Padella Stokovs says his client is innocent when it comes to espionage. The
 whole case as Stokovs claims is an exercise in politics.
<TURN>
 This is the first time in <TIMEX2 val="P40Y" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">almost 40 years</TIMEX2> that a foreign national is being
 tried for espionage. It's quite blatant.
<TURN>
 Officials from the security force, which used to be the KGB, are openly
 boasting about taking an American citizen to court.
<TURN>
 Way back in <TIMEX2 val="1961" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1961</TIMEX2> US military pilot Garry Powers was tried and sentenced but
 later on exchanged for a captured Soviet spy. But Powers was caught
 red-handed. His U2 spy plane was brought down by Soviet Air Defenses. Pope
 was arrested as he was trying to purchase blue prints for what he says is a
 <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">10-year-old</TIMEX2> underwater propulsion system or as the prosecutions claims ultra
 modern, secret Russian torpedoes. <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02T20:33:41.53" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">Former</TIMEX2> Russian Army Intelligence Officer,
 Vitaly Schlikov says Pope could easily have been a victim of the Russian
 obsession with secrets.
<TURN>
 We have of course a secrecy culture in this country for <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02T20:33:41.53" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">decades</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02T20:33:41.53" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">decades</TIMEX2>
 and reminisce of it are coming to the surface in this case. The laws on
 secrecy are still intact from <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the times of the Soviet Union</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 Guilty or not, Pope is being held under a very harsh regime in the Moscow
 Lefrotovo prison where his wife Sherry visited him <TIMEX2 val="2000-W43" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 We took two pictures of our grandson and they won't let him keep the
 pictures and I took a coat and gloves and they wouldn't let him have those,
 but we did get to embrace and we did get to talk about our family for <TIMEX2 val="PT1H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W43" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">one
 hour</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 Prison rules say that an inmate can only receive approved gifts on the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-4" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="how to do 'the first thursday of a month'?">first</TIMEX2>
 and <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-4" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">third Thursday in a month</TIMEX2>. And Sherry Pope's short-term visa didn't
 enable her to stay that long. She says she even appealed to the Russian
 President.
<TURN>
 Ed's mother and I both wrote letters to President to ask him to please take
 into consideration that Ed is <TIMEX2 val="P54Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">54 years old</TIMEX2> and that we want him home.
<TURN>
 Military intelligence analyst Vellary Schlikov says Putin is probably caught
 between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the American's trail.
<TURN>
 I'm sure that it came unexpected for Putin. He wouldn't have approved on a
 case like this because politically it is very harmful but he came from the
 ranks of the FSB himself. He has to pretend that he is sticking to his guns
 in this case.
<TURN>
 In Schlikov's opinion, Pope is likely to get convicted. But he believes that
 immediately after the sentencing Pope is likely to be pardoned by Moscow.
 US Congressman John Peterson, who has been championing Pope's cause, says he
 fears that might be too late for Pope.
<TURN>
 The main thing we have been pushing for <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">months</TIMEX2> is health care. Earlier we
 had asked for an American doctor to see him. When they continued to say no
 then we found Russian doctors. The judge delayed the trial for <TIMEX2 val="P1.5D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">a day and a
 half</TIMEX2> so we could furnish her with a list of doctors and hospitals in Moscow
 and after we provided that information she said no.
<TURN>
 Pope's lawyer Pavelo Strakovs says that what the authorities here call
 medical care is a joke.
<TURN>
 In Pope's case medical control means <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">everyday</TIMEX2> testing for his suspected
 cancer. What they do here is take his blood pressure and temperature. The
 very least they could do is take blood tests and bone marrow tests. The
 court has even rejected our demand for medical expertise to establish
 whether he is fit to stand trial.
<TURN>
 As Strakovs says he does not trust the Judge Nena Barkova at all. He says
 she has rejected almost every one of his 40 objections and suggestions
 during the trail so far. Strakovs is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02T20:33:41.53" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> trying to arrange for fresh
 witnesses for his defense of Edmund Pope, but is not hopeful that even that
 will be granted by the court. For The World, this is Nened Chebeck in
 Moscow.
