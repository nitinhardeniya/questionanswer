 here's where this leaves us, 
florida's 25 electoral vote still remain the key to winning 
this election. the completed recount that shows 
george w. bush leading by 327 votes is still unofficial. 
another recount is said to be begin in two counties and there 
are still absentee ballots, we just were discussing to count. 
nbc news correspondent kerry sanders has our report.
<TURN>
the counting is not over yet. the gore campaign requesting 
four counties recount their votes again. 
<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this time</TIMEX2> by hand. the bush campaign says it's not 
fair.
<TURN>
the more often ballots are recounted, especially by hand, 
the more likely it is that human errors, like lost ballots and 
other risks will be introduced.
<TURN>
velutia and palm beach will begin <TIMEX2 val="2000-W45-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this weekend</TIMEX2>. 
but they're not hand counting ballots in that county. they're looking for
samples like 
this one, not fully punched, which would prevent the machine 
from counting the vote. in brower, they chose three 
heavily democratic precincts. republicans could have chosen 
precincts, too, but only if they requested a hand recount, and 
they have not, standing by the statewide recount that shows 
bush leading.
<TURN>
this is simply an attempt to achieve a desired result, post 
election.
<TURN>
but it's absentee voters who could decide this election. 
more than 7,000 absentee ballots sent overseas have not yet been 
returned. the deadline for mail-in ballots 
is <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">10 days from election day</TIMEX2>. that's <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next friday</TIMEX2>. 
republicans confident most of those votes will go to bush. 
many from the military, stationed abroad. 
and in this case, from a first-time voter in england 
attending university.
<TURN>
it's just amazing to think that my little overseas ballot 
that i didn't really expect to even be counted is so crucial to 
whose going to be the next president of the united states.
<TURN>
but the gore campaign expects a strong showing from overseas, 
too. from israel, counting on voters 
like high and debbie noonan who live there part time.
<TURN>
i only hope that both parties will be big enough to realize at 
some point it has to stop .
<TURN>
not all overseas ballots come back. 
but election officials say about 80% do. 
that's because anyone who takes <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the time to request a ballot</TIMEX2> is 
usually considered a highly motivated voter.
