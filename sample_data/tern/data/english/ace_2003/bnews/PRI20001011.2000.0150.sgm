 President Clinton has signed a 19 billion-dollar spending bill for parks in
 conservation. It's only the third of thirteen annual spending bills that
 must be completed before congress can go home. NPR's Pam Fessler reports.
<TURN>
 The President called the interior appropriations measure historic, in large
 part because it creates a new program to devote hundreds of millions of
 dollars to land and water conservation. He praised the spirit of
 bipartisanship that lead to the bills passage. But truly afterwards the
 house dealt the President a setback. It voted 315 to 98 to override his
 veto last week of a 24 billion-dollar energy and water spending bill. The
 administration opposes a provision in the bill to prevent the army core of
 engineers from changing the flow of the Missouri river to protect wild life.
 But lawmakers in Missouri and neighboring states say the core's plan could
 cause flooding in the region and harm the barge industry. They say the veto
 will be a campaign issue in Mid-western states. Pam Fessler, NPR News,
 Washington.
