 And on we go to check our facts and figures on the business page. The major
 stock averages on Wall Street plunged sharply <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early Wednesday</TIMEX2> after some
 negative corporate earnings news. The market recovered lost ground during
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2>, but still ended with losses. VOA's Elaine Johanneson has a report
 for us from New York.

 After dropping over 400 points in early trading, the DOW Jones industrial
 average closed about 115 points or 1% lower at 9975. It was the DOW's first
 close below 10,000 since <TIMEX2 val="2000-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last March</TIMEX2>. The S&AMP;P 500 index fell eight points.
 Meanwhile, the technology-weighted NASDAQ composite, after plunging nearly 6
 percent, cut its loss to just over 1 percent. The blue chips came under
 pressure after the world's biggest computer maker IBM said earnings were on
 target, but <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q3" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">third quarter</TIMEX2> sales were disappointing. IBM stock plunged 15
 percent. Also number two US bank Chase Manhattan said, losses on its
 technology investments cut deeply into its <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q3" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">quarterly</TIMEX2> results. After all the
 slipping and sliding of <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W42" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent weeks</TIMEX2>, analysts are still not sure the market
 is ready to climb back. Elaine Johanneson, VOA News, New York.
