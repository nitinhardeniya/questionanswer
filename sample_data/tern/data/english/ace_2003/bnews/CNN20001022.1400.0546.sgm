 a russian navy spokesman says bad weather could complicate the work to recover
 bodies from the sunken nuclear submarine "kursk."
 russian and norwegian divers successfully removed a rubber coating between the
 inner and outer hulls of sub yesterday.
 thick fog, rain and high winds are limiting visibility at the site.
 all 118 people on board the "kursk" died when the submarine exploded and sank
 to the bottom of the barents sea.
