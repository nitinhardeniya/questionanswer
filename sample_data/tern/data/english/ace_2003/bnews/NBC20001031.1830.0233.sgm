 and in the middle east tonight, more worries
 about terrorism. the pentagon issues a new
 warning for u.s. servicemen in saudi arabia and kuwait.
 joining us now is nbc's pentagon correspondent, jim miklaszewski.
 jim, what prompted this latest alert?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
 u.s. intelligence picked up more credible and
 imminent terrorist threats. so now all american troops in
 the persian gulf are at the highest state of alert --
 threat con delta. as the "uss cole" prepares
 to come home -- 20 miles out to sea,
 the crippled "cole" is loaded onto the heavy lift ship, "blue
 marlin." in this navy satellite video,
 the marlin actually submerges. tugs push the cole into position
 over the deck, and the marlin rises to lift the 8,000 ton
 warship out of the water. the cole will take the long way
 home, around the southern tip of africa on its way to norfolk,
 avoiding the shorter route through the suez canal
 because of ongoing terrorist threats.
 the trip will take 35 days. meanwhile, major parts of the
 "cole" investigation are at a standstill tonight.
 yemen authorities are still not cooperating with the fbi, at
 least fully. and u.s. officials report that
 the suspects,  they
 have  no
 firm evidence to link any possible
 suspects to the attack on the "cole."
 tom?
