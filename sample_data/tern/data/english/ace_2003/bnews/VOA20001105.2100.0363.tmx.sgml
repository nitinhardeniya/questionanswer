 As we have been reporting, the White House confirms Israeli Prime Minister
 Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are going to meet separately
 with President Clinton <TIMEX2 val="2000-W45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later this week</TIMEX2>. Meanwhile, there has been continued
 trouble in the streets of West Bank and the Gaza Strip with at least two
 more Palestinians killed, <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> in clashes with Israeli troops. Laurie
 Kassman reports the trouble came despite an impassioned plea from Prime
 Minister Barak that Mr. Arafat rein in the rioters and return to the
 negotiating table.

 On <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>, Palestinians reported more than 30 injuries. But reports of
 the fighting also talked of a drop in the level of violence, since both
 sides agreed to a cease-fire <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late Wednesday night</TIMEX2>. More than 170
 Palestinians have died and more than 6000 are reported to have been wounded
 in clashes with the Israeli military. Several Israeli soldiers and
 civilians have also been killed. Shopkeepers in East Jerusalem are being
 urged to close their doors to protest against the killing of two Palestinian
 teenagers on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, Southeast of Jerusalem. Both Arab and Israeli
 businesses are suffering from the latest violence. A shopkeeper in the Arab
 town of Jaffa, which is adjacent to Tel Aviv, complains that few Israelis
 venture into the area since clashes erupted there <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W44" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">a few weeks ago</TIMEX2>. Jaffa is
 usually bustling with Israeli and foreign tourists.

 All our work is dependent totally on the Jews. If they are not coming, so
 really we cannot work. I mean, what happens that the Arabs here, the 20,000
 Arabs in   is dependent on the Jews going to their market and the
 Jews coming here. So we cannot live, I mean, we are really totally
 paralyzed <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-05T21:06:03.55" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have

 tensions and get the peace process back on track. The meetings will take
 place later in <TIMEX2 val="2000-W45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the week</TIMEX2> after the US presidential vote on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>. Laurie
