 just before our last story, a brief review of the main one.
 the u.s. is bringing home most of its investigators from yemen.
 they've been investigating the atck on the "uss cole," but they tell us tonight
 that they have hit a brick wall.
 you can see from the damage on the "cole" today, these are the latest and
 closest pictures we've ever had, why they might be frustrated.
 investigators for the fbi wish the yemeni government would have let them
 interview more witnesses.
