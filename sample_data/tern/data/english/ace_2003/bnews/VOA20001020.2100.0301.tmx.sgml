 A Moscow court has denied a request by US spy suspect Edmund Pope for a
 medical examination, despite his rare bone cancer. Mr. Pope's condition has
 gone untreated since he was jailed <TIMEX2 val="2000-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">five months ago</TIMEX2>. Russia accuses the
 former US naval intelligence officer of illegally obtaining secrets about a
 high-tech Russian torpedo. On <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> the court denied a series of defense
 motions that also included a request to tape the proceedings and replace the
 court translator, who works for Russian security. The trial opened
 <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> and has been suspended until <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>.
