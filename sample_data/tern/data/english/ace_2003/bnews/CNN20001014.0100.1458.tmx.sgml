 <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">saturday night</TIMEX2>, 51 women hit the stage in atlantic city competing for a title
 that's been around for <TIMEX2 val="P80Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1920" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">80 years</TIMEX2>.
 but despite its age, organizers say this will be a very modern miss america
 pageant.
 bill tush reports.
<TURN>
 there they are.
<TURN>
 there they are, <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>'s 51 contestants for the coveted title of miss
 america.
<TURN>
 i am miss west virginia, and my platform is "vote america."
<TURN>
 as sure as the leaves changing color in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the fall</TIMEX2>, for <TIMEX2 val="P80Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past 80 years</TIMEX2>, young
 women have descended upon atlantic city to vie for the title of miss america.
 and <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every year</TIMEX2>, there's a new wrinkle to what has become america's favorite
 real-life fairy tale.
 i was told that <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>'s miss america pageant is going to be hipper than in
 <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">past years</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 yes, it definitely is.
<TURN>
 actually, they tell us that <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every year</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 right.
 but i think <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, they followed through.
 7777
<TURN>
 <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2> is a lot of lights -- strobe lights, and kind of rave techno music,
 which is really kind of exciting.
<TURN>
 they're trying to kind of go with that britney spears kind of look for the
 opening number.
<TURN>
 it's certainly something that i think will be more evocative of what you might
 see on mtv.
 7777
<TURN>
 competing in swimsuit --
<TURN>
 didn't they -- <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">one year</TIMEX2> i think they tried to eliminate it?
<TURN>
 yes, they did.
<TURN>
 but <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-14T01:24:18.34" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> it's back?
<TURN>
 and the voters decided to keep it.
<TURN>
 but it's not just appearance that these young women are being judged on.
 there's also talent.
 and in the case of miss iowa, indomitable spirit.
 now, let me ask you, you said your talent, which i just read, is baton.
<TURN>
 yes.
<TURN>
 is that difficult to do with one hand?
<TURN>
 for me, it's not difficult, because i was born without my hand, and i've never
 known any different.
 but sure, it seems very challenging for people.
<TURN>
 and while winning the crown for most would mean --
<TURN>
 a dream come true for me.
<TURN>
 for others --
<TURN>
 it's a moment in our lives.
 and it's a really exciting one, but it doesn't last forever.
<TURN>
 what does last are the friendships.
<TURN>
 the best part is meeting all the girls.
 you know, when i came, i was really anxious about girls being vicious and out
 for blood, but they're absolutely not like that at all.
<TURN>
 everybody's friends, right?
<TURN>
 yes.
<TURN>
 that's not just making that up?
<TURN>
 no.
<TURN>
 okay.
<TURN>
 no, we wouldn't lie to you.
<TURN>
 speaking of honesty --
<TURN>
 honestly, i don't think i'm smooth enough to be miss america.
<TURN>
 it'll be up to the judges to decide on that <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">saturday night</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 i'm right in front of the judges, too.
 so if i mess up, it's big-time.
<TURN>
 ooh, that's -- okay, well, don't mess up.
<TURN>
 i won't.
<TURN>
 miss arizona.
