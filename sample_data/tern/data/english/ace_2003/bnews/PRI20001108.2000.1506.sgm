 In Moscow, today there was a dramatic plot twist in a real life courtroom
 drama. A lawyer for US spy suspect, Edwin Prope said that the main
 prosecution witness has retracted his testimony. According to Prope's
 attorney the witness said he provided the evidence under pressure from the
 Russian Secret Service. Eversince Prope was arrested 7 months ago, the
 American businessmen has denied charges that he was gathering secret
 information on a new high-speed Russian torpedo. The Worlds Menet Scheveck,
 is following the trial in Moscow. Menet, go back and tell us just how we
 got here? Who is Edwin Prope and why is he on trial in Russia?
<TURN>
 Well, Edwin Prope is a retired American intelligence officer and that's sort
 of speaks against him when it comes to the Russian public and certainly the
 Russian court. He has claimed that he is now just an innocent businessman,
 who was dealing with the Russian businesses orbit in the Defense Industry.
 He has, however, claimed that he is only dealing with the de-classified
 military material and that when it comes to these torpedoes that we are
 talking about, that he was buying an underwater propulsion system, which is
 10-years old. What the Russian prosecution is claiming is that Pope was
 actually after ultramodern secret high-speed Russian torpedoes.
<TURN>
 Okay, so tell us what happened in the trial this morning and bring in this
 professor from one of Moscow's elite universities who is a key witness?
<TURN>
 The big news of today was that Pope's attorney distributed to journalists
 this morning a letter, which he says was written by Tolly Babkin, who is a
 Professor at Moscow's Bowmen Technical Institute, who until now was
 considered to be the main witness for the prosecution. He says that he gave
 that evidence under pressure having had a grave heart condition proceeding a
 heart attack. Professor Babkin says that he never actually met Edwin Pope
 face to face, nor has he given him any kind of sensitive information,
 therefore, his former testimony is to be considered as not corresponding to
 reality says this letter by Professor Babkin. However, the court today
 again, this is what we were told by Pope's lawyer, has decided not to accept
 this change in testimony. The court said that Professor Babkin had ample
 opportunities to appear in the court. What is not clear at this moment is
 that whether it will allow a personal appearance by Professor Babkin, in
 which he could sort of say what he said in this letter.
<TURN>
 Then I would assume that the Professor is still ailing. I mean, is he able
 to take the stand, is there any indication that he will be asked to?
<TURN>
 No he is not able to take the stand at the moment. He is recuperating after
 a heart attack, but Pope's lawyer has said that court session could actually
 take place in the apartment of Professor Babkin. We still have to wait and
 see whether the court will accept that.
<TURN>
 So how important is this evidence? I mean how pivotal a figure is he? Is
 he providing evidence of no one else can?
<TURN>
 Well. From what we have heard so far, this is supposed to be like a key
 witness, a very important witness, but then the first reaction came from the
 FSB, the Federal Security Bureau, which is the former KGB, they are the ones
 who are prosecuting Pope. Their spokesman said today that their evidence is
 far from being based only on Babkin's testimony. He said that FSB has
 evidence given by other witnesses and experts, as well as, written documents
 and videos.
<TURN>
 This is not, what would know as a standards of American style trial
 certainly, first of all of the proceedings are conducted entirely in secret.
 What is the defense attorney for Admen Pope saying about the conduct in
 the trial?
<TURN>
 Well. He is very unhappy with the main judge. Pope is not being trailed by
 Jury. He has been trailed by panel of judges headed by judge Nina Barkolla
 and what we have heard from the defense attorney Pavals Tokov is that she
 has rejected almost every single one of, over 40 objections and suggestions
 that he has so far submitted during the case. He is very unhappy with the
 way she has been conducting the whole case and also with the fact that she
 has denied Edmund Pope the proper medical attention that he has asked for.
<TURN>
 And what has like that it happened should Admen Pope get convicted. Would
 he actually serve time?
<TURN>
 Well. Most of the people I have spoken here believe that that would not be
 the case, that since the case is already being brought to court that he is
 most likely to get convicted, but will then afterwards be pardoned either by
 the president or the parliament, and then sent back home for reasons of ill
 health, but most people here do expect a conviction at the end of this
 trial.
<TURN>
 It was Menet Shebeck in Moscow talking to us about the espionage trial in
 Moscow of American Admen Pope. Thank you very much Menet.
<TURN>
 You are welcome Lisa.
