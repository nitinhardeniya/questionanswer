 Congratulations from foreign leaders poured into the governor's mansion in
 Texas today. The messages were addressed to President-elect George W. Bush
 and they all contained words of welcome and optimism. But truth be told for
 most international figures, Bush is something of an unknown. He has
 travelled little and his diplomatic experience is limited to contacts with
 Mexican officials during his tenure as governor. The World's Jeb Sharp has
 been hunting down clues to the foreign policy of the incoming
 administration.
<TURN>
 A few broad foreign policy themes emerged during the campaign. Chief among
 them are debate over the wisdom of US intervention. Bush clearly favors
 limiting the use of American force and troops to solve conflicts overseas.
 Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace says that
 view is consistent with the philosophies of two top Bush advisors, Russia
 expert Condoleezza Rice and retired General Colin Powell.
<TURN>
 Certainly, Condoleezza Rice, certainly Colin Powell who I expect, the two of
 them to be the dominant force in the next administration on foreign policy.
 I certainly think they believe they would like to not intervene as much as
 the Clinton administration or I guess the previous Bush administration did.
<TURN>
 In fact, Condoleezza Rice who is slated to become Bush's National Security
 Advisor has already said she'd like to see US troops pulled home from the
 Balkans. But, Robert Kagan says its one thing for Bush's advisors to state
 a philosophy, its quite another to implement it.
<TURN>
 I think they may find the world has a way of intruding itself and that it
 won't be that easy to pull forces out of the Balkans for instance, without
 destroying the NATO alliance. After Rice made some comments about having a
 new division of labor, I think that was the word she used with regard to
 NATO and peacekeeping issues, there was a riot in Europe and the real fears
 that the United States was getting ready to withdraw from the continent and
 I think they had to walk that back a little bit.
<TURN>
 The Balkans is just one example where the Bush administration will have to
 walk a fine line in delineating a different approach from that of Mr.
 Clinton. The foreign policy challenges facing the next President are
 daunting. The Mid East peace process is on hold with Israelis and
 Palestinians practically at war. The sanctions regime against Iraq has
 unraveled. Russia and China are alarmed at the prospect of America beefing
 up its missile defenses. India and Pakistan, now nuclear powers are locked
 in a dangerous standoff. Stability in East Asia is another pressing
 concern. But despite the challenges, Northeast Asia expert Bates Gil of the
 Brookings Institution is encouraged by what he knows of the Bush foreign
 team.
<TURN>
 One of the most interesting aspects of the new likely team under the Bush
 administration is first of all, extensive experience in defense and military
 affairs. Secondly, it's easy to point to a number of persons who will have
 leading positions who have had extensive experience in East Asian affairs.
 So you have a combination of depth of experience plus an understanding of
 the region.
<TURN>
 Both of which will come in handy if there is a crisis with China over Taiwan
 or relations with North Korea deteriorate. In such a crisis, Bush is likely
 to rely on the advice of government officials who cut their teeth during the
 cold war. Some critics like Gore advisor Bush Jenosen worry that the Bush
 team will be out of step with today's issues.
<TURN>
 Issues related to globalization, global public health, technology, and those
 challenges. Yet in my view a truly realistic policy cannot be based only on
 the old agenda issues, really has to address these new agenda issues as
 well.
<TURN>
 But no matter what sort of expertise Bush's international affairs people
 bring to the White House, they won't be able to fully control what happens
 on their watch. Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment for International
 Peace says each President's foreign policy is ultimately shaped by events,
 not theories.
<TURN>
 Really, most of a President's foreign policy comes down to how they respond
 to specific events. Bill Clinton did not come in to office intending to
 send troops to Haiti and the Balkans, and events sort of forced his hand and
 I think that, you know, the truth is Bush administration comes in with
 certain kinds of prejudices, but we will have to see how they respond to
 crises. And the only thing that I'm confident of is that there will be
 crises.
<TURN>
 President-elect Bush is expected to begin naming his top cabinet picks in
 the next few days. Those choices will mean everything when the first crisis
 rolls around. For The World, I'm Jeb Sharp.
