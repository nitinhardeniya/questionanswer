 Episodes of a growing number of old and new television series are available
 in the United States for sale or rental, on videocassettes and on digital
 videodiscs or DVD's. One of the latest is the comedy 'Friends', which has
 been a <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-5TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday night</TIMEX2> success on American television since <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>.
 Entertainment reporter Chuck Rich spoke to VOA's Dave Arlington about
 'Friends' and other examples of television video.
<TURN>
 'Friends' is about the lives and especially the love lives of a group of
 mostly single young people in New York City. Ten episodes of 'Friends' are
 <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-22T20:22:30.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> on tape and disc. Here's a typical scene in which some of the characters
 are teasing Monica, played by Courtney Cox, about an impending social
 engagement.
<TURN>
   who want to buy or rent episodes of a less popular TV
 program like for example, the rather obscure 'Eerie Indiana'.
<TURN>
 Well because there aren't too many chances to see it on TV. Not many people
 were interested in watching 'Eerie Indiana' when it was in production for
 only <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">one season</TIMEX2> in <TIMEX2 val="199" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the early 1990's</TIMEX2>. But 'Eerie Indiana' had a small but
 devoted group of fans including my wife and me and since it was hard to find
 broadcaster or cable TV showings of its re-runs, I was very glad to see
 'Eerie Indiana' on home video. It's a dark comedy about a boy named Marshal
 played by Amourie Kats who discovers all kinds of on and scary things going
 on in a seemingly quiet little town. For example, if you listen to this TV
 clip, you can hear Elvis Presley, yes, still alive, picking up a newspaper
 from his lawn.
<TURN>
 Quick, take me away from this center of weirdness and give me something to
 cheer me up.
<TURN>
 Okay, fair enough. Here's a comedy variety show <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-22T20:22:30.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> on Home video, which was
 one of the most popular programs on TV <TIMEX2 val="1970" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">thirty years ago</TIMEX2>. The Flip Wilson
 show was known for guest stars, music, comedy sketches, an unusual theater
 in a round setting and various characters played by Mr. Wilson. The most
 popular was a woman, Geraldine.
<TURN>
 Geraldine.
<TURN>
 Geraldine, here being interviewed by guest star David Frost. The subject is
 Geraldine's boyfriend who goes by the not so romantic name, Killer.
<TURN>
 You never know when some old TV series will also come back as a new movie.
<TURN>
 Right, some have been successful and some haven't. Recently American
 moviegoers have turned out in large numbers to see Drew Barrymore, Cameron
 Diaz and Lucy Lu in a big screen version of 'Charlie's Angels', which was a
 TV series from <TIMEX2 val="1976" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1976</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="1981" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1981</TIMEX2>. And a couple of 'Charlie's Angels' TV episodes
 have come out on Home video, probably to benefit from the success of the
 movie. Here's a scene from one of those episodes in which the Angels, three
 female detectives and their associate Bosley are talking things over with
 the unseen Charlie, played by actor John Porcelight, speaking as always over
 a speaker phone.
<TURN>
 Endangered species. They were three original Charlie's Angels, then
 'Replacement Angels', <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-22T20:22:30.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> the new movie 'Angels', sounds more like a
 population explosion.
<TURN>
 With the 'Charlie's Angels' movie a hit at the box office, there might be
 more movies and more angels in our future. And thanks to the movie, the
 'Charlie's Angel's' TV theme is on peoples minds again.
<TURN>
 Thank you Chuck.
<TURN>
 You're welcome Dave.
