 the pentagon is urging u.s. military commanders to strengthen anti-terrorist
 measures in the wake of the "uss cole" attack.
 defense secretary william cohen and joint chiefs of staff chairman general
 henry shelton made the plea in a video teleconference with american commanders.
 17 sailors were killed and 39 wounded when the "cole" was attacked as it
 refueled in the port of aden, yemen.
 u.s. officials are denying a newspaper report that claims intelligence agencies
 have obtained hard evidence linking saudi terrorist osama bin laden to the
 bombing.
 "usa today" reports some evidence that has been uncovered shows bin laden
 financed the attack and assigned one of his top assistants to supervise it.
