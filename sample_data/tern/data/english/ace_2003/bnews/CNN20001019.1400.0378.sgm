 the nuclear submarine "kursk" could become a permanent underwater grave for 118
 russian sailors.
 russia's top admiral says he may scrap efforts to recover the bodies if experts
 decide the mission would endanger deep sea divers.
 all those aboard the "kursk" were killed in august when the sub sank after
 being damaged by an explosion in the barents sea.
 the cause of the disaster has not been determined.
 an international salvage team is due to arrive at the scene of the accident
 tomorrow.
