 former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has cleared the first hurdle
 in his political comeback.
 israel's parliament has given preliminary approval to a change in the law, a
 move that would allow him to run for prime minister in upcoming elections.
 under current law, netanyahu cannot run, since he does not hold a parliamentary
 seat.
 he's hoping to unseat current prime minister ehud barak.
 the bill still has to pass three more readings before becoming law.
