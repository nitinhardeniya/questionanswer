 at the bottom of the sea.
 two months after the submarine "kursk" went down with 118 men on board, dives
 have managed to get inside.
 they found five bodies so far.
 and today, they found a note, written after a pair of explosions ripped through
 the hull and sent the "kursk" into the depths of the bairnts see.
 here's abc's bob woodruff.

 the note was discovered by divers inside one compartment of the submarine, on
 the body of 27-year-old lieutenant captain dmitry kolesnikov, photographed here
 on board the "kursk" three years ago.
 "i am writing blindly," he wrote apparently in darkness.
 "none of us can get to the surface."
 russian officials believe the note was written at least two hours after the sub
 began to sink.
 "all the crew from the sixth, seventh and eighth compartments went over to the
 ninth."
 kolesnikov wrote, "there are 23 people here.
 we made this decision as a result of the accident."
 the note contains no new evidence about what sank the "kursk," whether it was
 an internal explosion or a collision.
 but it does contradict the official russian version that was given to family
 members, that all 118 men had died instantly.
 today, the chief of russia's navy was forced to admit to the families he was
 wrong, that some of the crew not only survived, according to kolesnikov's note,
 two or three tried to get out through the escape hatch.
 but it may have been flooded.
 today, kolesnikov's widow could not hold back her tears.
 "it's horribly painful, it's awful," she said.
 "i had a feeling that he didn't die immediately, and it turned out my feeling
 was right."
 she also says her husband had a premonition.
 last summer, before he wento sea, he gave her his dog tag and a crews fix.
 and said he may not be coming back.
