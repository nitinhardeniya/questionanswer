 A court in Moscow has convicted American businessman Edmund Pope of spying
 and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. Pope, a retired naval officer from
 Pennsylvania, was accused of illegally obtaining secret blueprints for a
 high speed Russian torpedo. He argued throughout the case that the
 information he obtained was already available to the public. The White House
 denounced the court action calling it unjustified and wrong. Pope's wife and
 his lawyers have also called for his release on health grounds, saying that
 he suffers from a rare form of bone cancer, which may have returned during
 his eight months in a Russian prison. Corey Flintoff, NPR News, Washington.
