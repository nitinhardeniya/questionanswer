 Welcome to another hour of news and information on the Voice of America.
 I'm David Chadwick, with VOA News now.
 The death toll in Colombia from three days of heavy fighting between
 soldiers and rebels now stands at more than 100. At least 54 soldiers and
 50 guerillas have died in clashes around the Northeastern cities of Bagado
 and Dabiara. Nearly all of the buildings, government buildings in those two
 cities, have been reportedly destroyed. The clashes began Wednesday, when
 the rebel revolutionary armed forces of Columbia launched attacks on a
 number of Northeastern towns. An army helicopter went down close to the
 border with Panama, killing all 22 soldiers on board.
