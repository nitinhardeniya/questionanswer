<TURN>
 In a letter to President Putin, Edmund Pope asked for clemency, saying he
 needs to return to the United States for medical treatment and to see his
 dying father. The head of the Presidential Pardon Commission said those
 humanitarian factors would be taken into consideration, and he said he hopes
 the commission will recommend a pardon. He also said he expects President
 Putin to act quickly on the commission's recommendation. Mr. Pope, who
 suffers from a rare form of bone cancer, was arrested <TIMEX2 val="2000-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last April</TIMEX2> and charged
 with illegally obtaining classified information on a Russian high-speed
 underwater torpedo. Mr. Pope maintained his innocence throughout the trial,
 saying the information he purchased was not secret and had already been sold
 overseas. On <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, a Russian court found him guilty and sentenced him
 to <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">20-years hard labor</TIMEX2>. Sonia Paes, VOA News, Moscow.
