 who are they? 60 million american families
 with more than $1 trillion in savings accounts that pay
 only 2% or 3% interest. most of them don't want any part

 their money up. surprisingly, 57% don't even
 have a clue what the interest rate is on their savings

 $1,000 in a savings account should consider putting some
 of that money in cds or savings bonds.

 for american families over a lifetime of saving.
