 Over in Green Bay, an injured Bret Forb
 extended his NFL record with his 136th straight start. Forb also improved
 to 25 and 0 at home again, temperature related when he is playing at 4
 degrees lower as he guided the Packers past the struggling Indianapolis
 Cults, 26-24. The Packers dominated the first three quarters in a game that
 began with swirling snow and left the field very slippery especially for the
 Cults receivers.
