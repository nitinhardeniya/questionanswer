 just before our last story, a brief review of the main one.
 the u.s. is bringing home most of its investigators from yemen.
 they've been investigating the atck on the "uss cole," but they tell us <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-27TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>
 that they have hit a brick wall.
 you can see from the damage on the "cole" <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, these are the latest and
 closest pictures we've ever had, why they might be frustrated.
 investigators for the fbi wish the yemeni government would have let them
 interview more witnesses.
