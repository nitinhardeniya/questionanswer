 President Clinton has urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to order the
 release on humanitarian grounds of a US businessman convicted of spying. A
 White House spokesman says the two leaders spoke by telephone today, after
 the Russian government's pardon commission recommended the release of Edmund
 Pope. Earlier, a senior Russian official said Edmund Pope could be home by
 Christmas. The former US naval intelligence officer was convicted and
 sentenced to 20 years in prison Wednesday, on charges he illegally obtained
 a classified information on a Russian torpedo.
