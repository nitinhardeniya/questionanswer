 While the United States uses a little honey <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-24T20:10:39.99" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2> in Korea to sweeten
 relations, vinegar is on the menu for some other countries, similarly
 designated state sponsors of terrorism. New legislation <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-24T20:10:39.99" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> awaiting President
 Clinton's signature is designed to leave a sour taste in the mouths of leaders
 of several countries considered guilty of terrorist acts against the United
 States. The World's Katy Clark reports on a successful push to win
 multi-million dollar awards for American victims of political violence.
<TURN>
 Known as the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, the bill would allow US
 courts to pay compensatory damages to victims of terrorism. The money would
 come from sources such as assets frozen in the United States which belong to
 countries implicated in terrorist activities. For instance, Cuban assets frozen
 by the United States would be used to compensate the families of anti-Castro
 pilots shot down by a Cuban Mig in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
 This is not about money, this is about punishing a terrorist country.
<TURN>
 Maggie Coey's brother was one of four men killed in that attack. She says the
 families will split more than fifteen million dollars. Those funds were awarded
 under previous legislation which allows American victims of terrorism in
 foreign countries to sue in US courts.
<TURN>
 We were the first families who used the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death
 Penalty Act of <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2> and we obtained the first judgement on that. However, there
 were no clear provisions for payment and as we tried to proceed with
 collection, the US government or the administration prevented us from doing so.
<TURN>
 Supposedly on the grounds that doing so would pose a national security risk,
 because it could antagonize terrorist nations. But as attacks against Americans
 are becoming increasingly common, Frank Gafney who heads the Washington DC
 based Center for Security Policy says the need to do something began to
 outweigh other concerns.
<TURN>
 This is being taken up in the context of upsurge in terrorism against
 Americans, not only forcing the act against USS Cole. So this is a period
 where, I think, clearly this kind of talk is broadly perceived on both sides of
 the political isle to be necessary and frankly long overdue.
<TURN>
 But Gafney says hitting terrorist nations up for compensation is an unusual and
 untested approach to try to curb their activities.
<TURN>
 Clearly when you're talking about people who are prepared to blow themselves
 up, the possibility that somebody else might pay material damages is probably
 not going to be upper most in their minds.
<TURN>
 But Gafney says state sponsors who fund suicide bombers do understand the
 language of money.
<TURN>
 And that state sponsor has reason to believe that this will translate into not
 only perhaps other forms of punishment but the loss of tens if not hundreds of
 millions of dollars. That may be a dissuasive consideration for them.
<TURN>
 The millions of dollars in compensation will not only go to the families of the
 Cuban-American pilots, but also to Terry Anderson who would get more than forty
 one million dollars in return for <TIMEX2 val="P7Y" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the nearly seven years he spent as a hostage
 in Lebanon</TIMEX2>. News of the bill has angered many governments abroad. Iranian
 officials have argued that the United States has no right to their government's
 money. And Cuba has threatened to cut off phone links to the United States if
 Washington moves to seize Cuban assets. But all this says Maggie Cooey, just
 goes to show that when negotiating with terrorist countries like Cuba, money
 talks.
<TURN>
 At <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the time of the last suit when they were declared guilty of murder and
 guilty of terrorism</TIMEX2>, they didn't care. They did not even show up in trial. Once
 we started the collection process they really got very upset. Terrorism is just
 a very cheap way of making war. So you have to go after the people who fund
 these actions and have them realize that they are going to have to pay. If
 President Clinton signs the bill in <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-24" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the next few days</TIMEX2> as expected, the
 plaintiffs would collect their money by <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of the year</TIMEX2>.
 For The World I'm Katy Clark.
