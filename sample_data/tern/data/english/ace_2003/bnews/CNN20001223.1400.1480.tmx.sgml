 toys are a serious business in one town in eastern germany, especially <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-23T14:24:40.40" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">around
 this time of year</TIMEX2>.
 chris burns reports.

 in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-23T14:24:40.40" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the middle ages</TIMEX2>, the town of seiffen was known for its mining industry.
 but as many mining towns have found out, the rich veins in the rocks weren't
 forever.
 so in a late example of radical economic restructuring, the miners had to turn
 to another source of livelihood.
<TURN>
 once that industry came to an end, people looked for different sources of
 income.
 in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-23T14:24:40.40" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="T-ERROR. Really can't tell what this is, except that it is in the past.">16</TIMEX2> for the first time, it showed toys at a fair.
 over <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the decades</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="PXCE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="20" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">centuries</TIMEX2>, the mining industry died down and at tension
 focused on toys.
<TURN>
 so they dropped their shovels, and away they went -- cutting, sawing,
 assembling, sanding, painting.
 no marketing survey needed then.
 kids will be kids, and <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">christmas</TIMEX2> comes <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every year</TIMEX2>.
 the business has staying power.
 despite all the high-tech video games on the market, the <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">christmas</TIMEX2> pyramid is
 still a hit.
 you can dress it up with candles.
 nutcrackers are also popular, wrought with the hands of the miners'
 descendants.
 candle holders come in various forms or with a tribute to seiffen's ancestors.
 this town of 3,000 fell under communist rule after the second world war, and
 its toy industry was nationalized in the early
<TURN>
 until <TIMEX2 val="1972" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1972</TIMEX2>, mostly toys were troughed and then under socialist rule, focus was
 played more and more on arts and crafts because it turned out to be an export
 hit.
 we took over and realized that these products are still popular.
<TURN>
 and they've gone a few steps further -- selling factory-to-you, and hawking on
 the internet.
 but if the salesmanship has become more sophisticated, the craftsmanship is
 pretty much like it was <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">hundreds of years ago</TIMEX2>, with a few variations.
