<TIMEX2 val="P1EV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">all this evening long</TIMEX2>, we have also seen some subtle shifts in 
the house and senate, and lester holt has been tracking 
those. lester?
<TURN>
brian, winds of change may be blowing through the u.s. 
senate. senator ron grams taking on 
mark dayton, dayton the democrat, the projected winner 
in the state of minnesotament now that follows an early 
pickup in delaware. let's look at the delaware race 
where earlier we called governor tom carper beats roth, 
54% to 46%. those are the current numbers. 
57% in, and look at missouri <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:35:34.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2>. 
that one still too close to call. 
mel carnahan, who died in the plane crash <TIMEX2 val="2000-W42" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three weeks ago</TIMEX2>, 
trailing john ashcroft, the incumbent barely. 
norah o'donnell has covered knows this stuff inside and 
outside, where does this take us? 
earlier you took me through the scenario, the strategy the 
democrats need to pick up the majority of the senate.
<TURN>
we're going to take you through it again. 
democrats need five seats to take back the senate. 
here is where we're at, according to the map. 
i'm going to sort of draw it here. 
they held on to new york as they needed to. 
they held on to new jersey with corzine spending his own money. 
they lost virginia. this is really going to hurt 
their chances and, of course, in nevada, we have not seen 
results yet there, but both parties had long predicted that 
republicans would pick up this seat. 
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:35:34.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> in florida, we know the democrats picked up this seat. 
we know in delaware that the democrats picked up this seat. 
and we <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:35:34.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> know -- as you just reported, lester, that the 
democrats have picked up minnesota. 
in order to then win back the senate, it means that democrats 
must win <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:35:34.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> all four of these -- knock off all four of these 
republican incumbents. that's very difficult to do.
<TURN>
they've got to go on a run and then they take back the 
senate.
<TURN>
the democrats at this stage are plus one, so they need four 
beat four incumbents which is hard to do.
<TURN>
a look at florida. florida's eighth district, this 
is an incredible race <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:35:34.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2>. 
ric keller, linda chapin. 95% in and this thing is tied 
up <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:35:34.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2> in florida. this is bill mccollum's seat.
<TURN>
this is home to disney world. 
if democrats cannot win this seat, then they're not likely 
to take back the house of representatives. 
they think this is a prime opportunity here, florida, if 
they can't win in that type of a district, it looks very bad 
for them across the country.
<TURN>
results in connecticut's second district the take a look 
at what's going on there if we can. 
all right.
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T21:35:34.67" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> we highlighted this particularly race because sam 
gejdenson who is the incumbent democrat there, at this early 
stage of the game appears to be behind in the numbers to rob 
simmons. this is what they call a second 
tier race. in other words sam should be 
ahead at this point. he's been in congress for a 
while and republicans have been saying, no, no, no we can beat 
this type of guy. if in fact republicans beat off 
some guy like dam, that means the republicans have made the 
type of gains, may not only keep their majority in the 
house of representatives but could increase it at this early 
stage. we've known republicans would 
do well in the northeast. it appears they're doing very 
well.
<TURN>
we have to get all the way to the west though before we 
know what's going to happen.
<TURN>
absolutely. the democrats expected to make 
gains in the west but we've been watching this whole 
corridor to see how republicans do. 
they had to hold their own and looks like they're doing quite 
well.
<TURN>
all right. we continue to track the senate 
and the house of representatives. 
winds have changed in the house of representatives. 
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">long night</TIMEX2> ahead of us.
