 Thousands of people in Botswana have lined up to view the remains of an
 African man whose body was stuffed and exhibited in a Spanish museum for
 nearly a century. The man was returned to Africa after complaints from the
 UN and other organizations that displaying his body was racist and
 offensive. The man will be buried at a funeral service tomorrow. You are
 listening to BBC news for The World I'm Kregor Cragy.
