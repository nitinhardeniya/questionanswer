 president clinton says he's willing to meet separately with israeli and
 palestinian leaders if both sides work to end the mideast violence.
 the president proposed the talks in a call to palestinian leader yasser arafat.
 mr. clinton says he wants to see arafat and israeli prime minister ehud barak
 abide by promises to end the bloodshed made at last week's emergency summit in
 egypt.
 a white house spokesman says arafat is reviewing the offer.
 meanwhile, some 30,000 anti-israeli protesters clashed with police in jordan.
 demonstrators from across the country traveled to a west bank border town to
 call for the return of palestinian refugees.
 the number of police and protesters who were injured is still not known.
