 will winter storms affect the weather where you are?
 let's check the "headline news extended forecast."
 another round of winter weather is expected today as another major winter storm
 will be spreading from the southern plains through the ohio river valley and
 eventually into the northeast.
 cities like springfield, missouri, back towards st. louis and indianapolis and
 columbus will pick up the heaviest snowfall.
 over six inches is expected by tomorrow morning, and then moving in towards the
 northeast, where we expect even some ice in some of the suburbs to the
 northwestern areas of new york city.
 here's a look at the forecast weather map -- slow pressure is moving in towards
 the ohio river valley and eventually into the northeast by late tomorrow.
 it's moving rather quickly, too, so the precipitation will be ending through
 the midwest as high pressure builds in tomorrow.
 look for the snow to continue into new england tomorrow.
 friday, rain into the southeast.
 there will be some showers in the northwest.
 temperaturewise, it remains cold over the northern tier.
 it begins to warm up over parts of the south.
 a wet day on saturday over much of the east and southeast.
 there'll be some snows, though, back into the midwest.
 forecast highs are still on the cold side.
 and as we check out sunday's weather, snow through the great lakes and rain
 into the northeast with forecast highs mainly in the over the northeastern u.s.
