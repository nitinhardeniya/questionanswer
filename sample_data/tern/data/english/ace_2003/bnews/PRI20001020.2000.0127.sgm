 The Navy has changed its account of the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen.
 Officials now say the ship was hit nearly two hours after it had docked.
 Initially the Navy said the explosion occurred while several boats were helping
 the ship to tie up. The change raises new questions about how the attackers
 were able to get past the Navy security.
