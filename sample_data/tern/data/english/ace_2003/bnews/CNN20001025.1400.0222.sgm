 campaigning in tennessee today, gore used a rand corporation study to attack
 bush on the issue of education.
 the study found higher scores in state-administered tests of texas students
 were not reflected in national exams.
 gore said the report undercuts bush's education record in texas.
 the bush campaign called the rand study inaccurate.
 gore and bush are now running neck-and-neck in tennessee, and gore is
 campaigning hard to avoid the embarrassment of losing his home state.
