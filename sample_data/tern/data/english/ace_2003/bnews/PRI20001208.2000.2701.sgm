 The United States is hoping that Russia's President Vladimir Putin will
 follow the advice of his special commission and pardon Edmund Pope. This
 week the American businessman began serving a 20-year prison sentence in
 Moscow after being convicted of spying. Specifically Russian prosecutors
 charged that Pope had stolen secrets relating to a high-speed Russian
 torpedo. Pope denied the charges and Washington backed him up. Marsha Lippin
 is Editor of Moscow based newsmagazine 'Itogi'. Marsha, did the Presidential
 Pardons Commission give any reason for their decision?
<TURN>
 It gave several reasons. I am not sure if those were the formal reasons but
 members of the commission have been interviewed today by various outlets and
 they say that they were afraid of the spy mania rising in Russia, that they
 thought it was really suspicious to them that Edmund Pope was sentenced to
 the maximum term, whereas the article of the law had 10 to 20 years. He was
 sentenced to 20, even though according to the members of the Pardon
 Commission, the evidence that was presented by the prosecution was far from
 quotient. They also said this court did not give the lawyers for the defense
 due procedure. The court listened to the defense much less than it did to
 the prosecution.
<TURN>
 Much of this sounds less like a pardon and more like a criticism of the
 number of institutions that Mr. Putin also has to show some support of,
 including his court system and his police and his prosecutors. How is he
 going to respond to this and when?
<TURN>
 I don't think anybody knows and I don't think anybody will know until
 President Putin has responded. It is his decision. According to the Russian
 law the Pardon Commission, after it has made its decision, sends it to the
 President and it's up to him whether to endorse it or not to say no.
<TURN>
 One last question for you, Marsha. He does have a lot to balance doesn't he,
 President Putin? Not only the institutions I mentioned but the need to keep
 things somehow free of tension. Is this case likely to strain US-Russian
 relations?
<TURN>
 I'm afraid it might. Recently the Russian policy toward the US has fallen
 into a line where Russia tries to demonstrate force it once had but no
 longer does. It wants to put an end to what is regarded by the current
 Russian government as humiliation of the past years. There were numerous
 attempts to be a source of minor troubles even though Russia can no longer
 be a source of scare to the west and among such instances there were
 several, there was just recently flying over by Russian military planes over
 Kitty Hawk, an American warship. There is also a scandal that erupted over
 Russia's declaration that it will sell weapons to Iran, contrary to the
 earlier made agreement. Such examples are quite a few already, some of them
 are combined with material profits for Russia but not necessarily.

 thank you very much for speaking with us.
<TURN>
 Pleasure.
