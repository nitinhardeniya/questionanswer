Clinton to Putin: Release American
</HEADLINE>

	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ President Clinton cited
humanitarian grounds in asking Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Wednesday to release an American accused of spying in Russia, an
administration official said.

	   The prisoner, Edmond Pope, 54, a lawyer from State College, Pa.,
was arrested April 3 by the Federal Security Service in Moscow on
suspicion of trying to buy secret blueprints for a high-speed
torpedo. If convicted in a secret trial, he could be sentenced to up
to 20 years in prison.

	   Pope waited six months in Moscow's Lefortovo prison for the trial
to open last month.

	   Pope's family says he has a rare form of bone cancer, which was
in remission when he traveled to Russia earlier this year.

	   Clinton and Putin were in Brunei for the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum. They met for 75 minutes over lunch on Wednesday.

	   The administration official, briefing reporters on condition his
name not be used, said the Pope case came up in their discussions.
``As he has before, the president expressed his concern about Mr.
Pope's condition, in particular his health,'' the official said.
``We're concerned about the course of the trial and the president
again urged the release of Mr. Pope on humanitarian grounds as soon
as possible.''

	   Asked what Putin replied, the official said only that ``the
Russians understand that we won't rest until Edmond Pope is home,
that we are deeply concerned about his condition.

	   ``We think President Putin understands these concerns and hope he
acts on them as soon as possible,'' the official said.
