Alps Flood Death Toll Rises to 22

	   PIACENZA, Italy (AP) _ Italy hurried 12,000 people from the path
of two raging rivers <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> as flood waters that wreaked death in
Alpine villages bore down on the medieval villages and cities of the
northern Italian plains.

	   The death toll in Italy and Switzerland rose to 22, with the
mud-caked body of a <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">1-year-old</TIMEX2> Italian boy among the latest
uncovered. A total of 25 people in the two countries were missing and
feared dead.

	   On <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>, emergency crews evacuated whole villages in the paths
of the Po, Italy's longest river, and the Ticino that feeds into it
from the Alps.

	   ``Even those who were reluctant to leave their homes, like the
elderly, eventually were convinced,'' said the Rev. Pier Luigi Rossi,
one of a few people left <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday afternoon</TIMEX2> in the riverside village
of San Rocco al Porto.

	   Water was climbing within inches of the sandbags newly lining the
Po, a few steps from Rossi's church. He too was leaving soon.

	   The Po already had burst its banks at some points; authorities
expected it to crest by <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> at the old trade town of Piacenza,
home to columned Romanesque churches and a Botticelli.

	   The Po divides the rich agricultural regions of Lombardy and
Emilia Romagna, emptying into the lagoons of Venice.

	   While there has been some flooding of churches, where much of
Italy's cultural patrimony is cached, the water generally has not yet
threatened works of art, Vincenzo Pandolfino of the Culture
Ministry's art protection squad said. Damage to Italy's countless
masterpieces was not expected to near that which Florence suffered in
a ruinous <TIMEX2 val="1966" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1966</TIMEX2> flood.

	   In both Italy and Switzerland, however, authorities said overall
damage would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

	   Flooding forced the Fiat auto giant to shut down two of its
biggest plants in its hometown of Turin. Blocked roads and railways
and inundated factories made it impossible for suppliers to deliver
parts, spokesman Franco Sodano said.

	   Officials were thinking of opening upstream dikes to ease the
threat to communities downstream, Public Works Minister Nerio Nesi
said.

	   ``We are in a state of anxiety, of high emergency,'' Nesi told
reporters, adding, ``The situation now could become very dangerous.''

	   Along the Ticino, water lapped at the third floors of evacuated
palazzos in the Roman-era Lombard town of Pavia. Firefighters ferried
food and clean water to the few holdouts who refused to leave.

	   The floods and landslides started <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> in southern
Switzerland and northern Italy, after <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-17" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">days of pounding rain across
the region</TIMEX2>. Flood water roaring out of the Alps brought Lake Maggiore
on the Swiss-Italian border to its highest level in <TIMEX2 val="P160Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">160 years</TIMEX2>.

	   Most of the victims were killed over <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the weekend</TIMEX2> when mud, rock
and water rushed through villages and towns, sweeping away even
massive stone houses.

	   In the Swiss village of Gondo, perched in the Alps above the
Italian border, rescuers digging through a layer of mud and rock were
finding only bodies <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>.

	   Hopes faded for the 10 people still missing in Switzerland.
Jean-Rene Fournier, president of the Valais canton (state)
government, said it now appeared that a body recovered <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> in
Gondo was that of a woman whom rescuers had heard faintly tapping
<TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">just hours before</TIMEX2> but who died before they could reach her.

	   With roads to Switzerland's famed ski resort of Zermatt blocked,
authorities used helicopters to fly out stranded tourists.
Seven-hundred had left by <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late Tuesday</TIMEX2>; 1,000 more were on a waiting
list.

	   Of the 22 confirmed deaths, 16 have occurred in Italy and six in
Switzerland.
