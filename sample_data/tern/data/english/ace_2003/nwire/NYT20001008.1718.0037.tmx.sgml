	   CANNES, France _ They came from Slovenia and Slovakia, from
Israel and Iceland, from Turkey and Colombia and the Republic of
Georgia, mostly middle-aged men, graying around the temples,
descending on the elegant Hotel Du Cap in their almost matching
monotone dark suits and ties.
	   The event that brought this group together was the first
international gathering of hosts of the game show, ``Who Wants To
Be A Millionaire,'' the British-created television sensation that
has literally swept the globe in a wave of high ratings. The 23
television personalities from six continents, assembled by the
show's production company, Celador, for a kind of team photo and
exchange of production ideas, were clearly overjoyed at the chance
to talk a little shop.
	   ``<TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Our celebrity week</TIMEX2> was huge,'' said Eddie McGuire, the host
from Australia.
	   ``We haven't done celebrities,'' said Alain Simons, a host from
Belgium. ``Do you tape two shows <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day</TIMEX2> or three? I find it hard to
concentrate when I have to do three.''
	   That a program like ``Millionaire,'' hatched in Great Britain,
not in the United States, took center stage at the MIPCOM
conference, the international television market held here <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">each year</TIMEX2>
where programming is bought and sold, was the most dramatic
evidence of how the long-time pecking order in the global
television business has been transformed over <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="unclear if this is point or duration; unclear if it means 12 mos or just 2000">the past year</TIMEX2>.
	   Throughout the history of the event, American production
companies dominated the conference, arriving as sellers confident
they could fill the schedules of most of the world's broadcasters
with translated or subtitled versions of everything from ``Hill
Street Blues'' to ``Baywatch.'' But <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, for the first time,
the Americans arrived as much as buyers as sellers, eager to
purchase the kind of European-based formats of reality shows, like
``Millionaire'' and ``Survivor,'' that have shaken up the entire
landscape of prime-time network competition in the United States,
the executives here said.
	   To underscore the sudden conviction that such European
programming is a necessary part of <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T17:18:00" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the future</TIMEX2> of the business,
American production companies like Warner Brothers and Paramount
are making plans to establish offices in foreign countries to
create local programs, or else to buy up foreign production
companies to jump-start them as local players in the
program-creation business.
	   None of this means that American programming does not sell. It
still does _ especially if it is a glossy action show with high
production values. The Walt Disney Corp. is reporting healthy sales
in international distribution. A Warner Brothers show for CBS, a
new version of the classic, ``The Fugitive,'' sold in almost every
foreign market in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">near record time</TIMEX2>, Warner executives said.
	   And top programs like ``E.R.'' and ``X-Files'' still have no
trouble selling in translation to channels around the world. But
second-tier programs are finding it harder and harder to do
business, several American production company executives said.
	   At the heart of the change is the success of offshore-created
formats like ``Millionaire'' and ``Survivor.'' The identification
of potential hit program formats _ adaptable to the U.S. market _
has become a kind of obsession with American production companies
and networks.
	   As one executive with a Hollywood talent agency put it,
``Formats are the coin of the realm at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T17:18:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the moment</TIMEX2>.'' The executive,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the pursuit of format
rights had begun to consume much of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">his time</TIMEX2>.
	   Nobody doubts that ``Millionaire,'' <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T17:18:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> on the air in 35
countries and sold as a format in 45 more, is the centerpiece of
the revolution. Paul Smith, the managing director of Celador, said
he takes special pride in one achievement.
	   ```Millionaire' broke the mold in America,'' he said. ``American
television networks have been very conservative. This has changed
their attitude toward overseas programs and <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T17:18:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> we suddenly have
two-way traffic.''
	   Indeed, the American buyers continue to snap the multicountry
formats up, partly because they want protection in case of a strike
by Hollywood actors and writers in <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="MID" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">mid-2001</TIMEX2>. When they can, they
would like very much to sell them as well, as indicated by efforts
here by three of large entertainment companies to buy the
international format rights to ``Survivor.'' Ben Silverman, an
agent from the William Morris Agency who has negotiated the deals
for numerous reality shows in <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past two years</TIMEX2>, said he is
talking with the three companies for the ``Survivor'' format rights
on behalf of Charlie Parsons, the British creator of the series. A
representative of Warner Brothers confirmed that the company is one
of those involved in the talks.
	   Silverman declined to mention the figures being discussed, but
another executive familiar with the negotiations said Parsons is
seeking about $30 million.
	   The companies talking about buying the format rights to
``Survivor'' want to cash in on what is expected to be the second
or third most potent format in international sales _ after
``Millionaire'' and possibly ``Big Brother,'' which has been an
enormous hit in Holland, Germany and, most recently, Britain, and
continues to sell well around the world despite results in the
United States.
	   The clout of the United States is still strong, if indirect, in
the category of game shows and talk shows that the Europeans lump
under the heading ``light entertainment.''
	   David Lyle, the head of light entertainment for Pearson
Television, one of the largest international distributors of
programming, said, ``When the States get excited about this variety
of show in all its forms, all of a sudden it gets fed back into
Europe, and they get more excited about it.''
	   Indeed, Silverman of the William Morris agency said that the
``second wave'' of these formats will start turning up on American
television sets in <TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January</TIMEX2>.
	   ``The performance of the second wave will be telling on <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T17:18:00" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the
future</TIMEX2> of these formats,'' Silverman said. ``Fox may have `Boot
Camp' on by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">November</TIMEX2>, and ABC will have `The Mole' ready by
<TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January</TIMEX2>. They're already shooting it in France. Then `Survivor II'
hits at <TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of January</TIMEX2>.'' 
	   ``Boot Camp'' sends a group of contestants through the rigors of
Marine-style training; ``The Mole,'' puts a group of people through
some scavenger-hunt type challenges, all of which are being
undercut by an unknown mole-and-actor in the group.
	   Waiting in the wings behind those shows are second-wave formats
like ``Public Property,'' <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T17:18:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> bought by ABC from Pearson, in
which six people turn their lives over for <TIMEX2 val="P1M" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a month</TIMEX2> to the viewers,
who tell them what to wear, what to eat, and maybe even what
romantic interest to dump.
	   Lyle has a show from Australia he is looking to sell to a U.S.
network possibly Fox or WB, called ``The $20 Challenge,'' which
transports three small-town twentysomethings to a big city, gives
them $20 each and tells them to find food and shelter for <TIMEX2 val="P3D" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three
days</TIMEX2> _ all accompanied by cameras crews, of course.
	   The Creative Artists Agency has hopes for a <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">decades-old</TIMEX2> German
format called ``Wetten Das'' _ loosely translated as ``Wanna Bet''
_ which alternates variety acts with oddball physical challenges.
On one show <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">a few years ago</TIMEX2>, Mikhail Gorbachev watched as a hugely
overweight man in pajamas tried to see if he could squeeze into a
tiny square in the stage. The man did.
	   And John DeMol, whose Endemol Entertainment, the creator of
``Big Brother,'' owns more formats than almost any other European
company, is ``100 percent sure'' he has another show that will
``work in the States.'' The show is ``Domino D-Day,'' in which more
than 1.5 million dominos, set up in intricate patterns over <TIMEX2 val="P3M" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three
months</TIMEX2> by 85 students, are knocked down in a live <TIMEX2 val="PT90M" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">90-minute</TIMEX2> show.
It was a big hit in Holland.
	   Some American executives suggest that the preoccupation with
formats may be a passing fad. Jeffrey Schlesinger, the president of
Warner Brothers International Television, who has <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">more than 20
years of experience making deals with foreign broadcasters</TIMEX2> said:
``The format business is something that is very exciting <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T17:18:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2>.
I would question how long it will last. I'm sure it's going to be
cyclical like other things in our business.''
	   But while the format fire rages, what all the shows are looking
for is what ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' has already achieved:
true global status. Smith of Celador is devoted enough to his show
to have actually been moved to tears by the interaction of so many
of his hosts. (Regis Philbin, the trademark American host, could
not attend because he had a commitment to his <TIMEX2 val="TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">morning</TIMEX2> talk show.)
	   The ``Millionaire'' format dictates everything from set to
lighting to music to those dark, solid-color clothes ensembles of
the hosts. Pamela Wallin in Canada and Maria Elisa in Portugal are
the only female hosts. Only Wallin made it for the team photo,
standing out in an electric blue suit. ``We want mature men for the
most part,'' Smith said. ``It adds to their authority.''
	   Some of the hosts were younger, including <TIMEX2 val="P27Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">27-year-old</TIMEX2> Duta
Skirtladze of Georgia. His producer, Giorgi Khaburzania who is 24,
said the show has become a smash in his country as well, even
though the prize, 20,000 laris, is the smallest in value of all
those around the world: approximately $10,000. Still, that is a
fortune in Georgia, he said. ``We are a poor country. To win 20,000
is very exciting.''
	   But Yonas, the single-named host from Slovenia complained to
Martin Nikodyn of Slovakia and Vladimir Cech of the Czech Republic,
that his top prize of 10,000,000 sits (about $70,000) is not enough
to inspire as much excitement. ``So I have to manufacture a lot of
the drama,'' Yonas said.
	   Smith addressed many of the issues of concern to his hosts
during a workshop for all the show's producers, where such things
as how to improve the number of female contestants and what to do
if a wrong answer is mistakenly established as the correct answer
were addressed.
	   One point was raised several times: very few countries have ever
had a top prize winner. But in the United States six people have
won $1 million.
	   ``America can certainly say it is still ahead of the rest of the
world on that,'' Smith said.
