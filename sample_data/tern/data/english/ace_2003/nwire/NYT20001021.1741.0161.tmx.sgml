	   In a landmark visit that signals an accelerating thaw in United
States relations with North Korea, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will leave <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday night</TIMEX2> to meet with the Communist leader,
Kim Jong Il, and to pave the way for a trip by President Clinton.
	   Albright will be the most senior American official to visit the
tightly controlled Stalinist state and Clinton would be the first
American president to go to North Korea since the Korean War began
<TIMEX2 val="1950" mod="BEFORE" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">more than 50 years ago</TIMEX2>.
	   The hasty arrangements for Albright's trip _ made in <TIMEX2 val="P10D" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-21" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">less than
10 days</TIMEX2> for a visit that would normally take <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">months</TIMEX2> to choreograph
_ were another signal of the Clinton administration's desire to
push ahead with improving relations before Clinton leaves office.
	   But the prospect of Clinton's making such an important foreign
visit so late in his presidency to a state the United States has
charged with supporting terrorism has raised mixed reactions from
experts on the region and a heated discussion even within his own
administration.
	   The usually reclusive North Korean leader made a surprising
debut on the world stage <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this year</TIMEX2>, holding a first-ever
summit meeting with a South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, during
which they made some progress in warming relations but left a raft
of issues unresolved.
	   Albright will be talking to the North Korean president about how
far his country is prepared to go in shutting down its missile
program and missile exports to countries hostile to the United
States, senior administration officials said.
	   North Korea's missile program has raised anxiety throughout the
region, particularly in Japan, and was cited as one of the main
reasons for the ambitious proposals in the United States to build a
national missile defense system.
	   Other issues on the table will be North Korea's support of
terrorism and how to reduce military tensions between North and
South Korea, where the United States still maintains some 37,000
troops along a heavily militarized border that Clinton himself
described at the start of his presidency as the ``scariest place on
earth.''
	   The sudden decision for Albright to travel to North Korea
follows a visit <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this month</TIMEX2> to the White House by Vice
Marshal Jo Myong Rok, a senior North Korean military official, who
issued an invitation for Clinton to go to Pyongyang, the North
Korean capital.
	   But the Pentagon is less enthusiastic about a presidential
visit. <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last month</TIMEX2> it released a report with a pessimistic
assessment about North Korea's military intentions, saying North
Korea showed no fundamental change in its posture.
	   The report said North Korea had stockpiled chemical weapons and
continued to develop its short-and long-range missiles, though it
had honored its pledge to American negotiators <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> that it
would not flight-test them.
	   The White House is clearly leaning toward going ahead with a
Clinton visit. ``Tell me why I shouldn't go,'' will be Albright's
mission on behalf of the president, a senior official said. The
official said Albright would be seeking to ``evaluate'' whether the
North Koreans would be prepared to move forward on the issues if
President Clinton does in fact go.
	   ``For North Korea, the president's visit is itself the prize,''
said Arnold Kanter, a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-21T17:58:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> under secretary of state in the Bush
administration. ``The question is what the United States is getting
in return that meets our needs to reduce the threat posed by North
Korea.''
	   As under secretary in <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2>, Kanter was the first high-level
American official to meet with a senior North Korean official.
	   Another critique came from Michel Oksenberg, a China expert who
served on the National Security Council during the Carter
presidency. He said the stakes were too high to rush into a visit
with a lame duck president. ``A presidential trip has to be
exquisitely planned and <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> is very short,'' Oksenberg said.
	   But administration officials have defended a possible Clinton
visit, saying they asked advice _ and got the approval _ from the
South Korean president before going ahead with Albright's trip.
	   They also make the case that the trip is part of a slow process
of negotiations with the North, which have already borne fruit with
the North's agreement <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> to temporarily freeze flight tests
of their missiles, which has been extended indefinitely.
	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last month</TIMEX2>, the North also stockpiled the last of the spent fuel
rods from its nuclear reactors, officials said, a move the United
States has wanted to help ensure that the fuel would not be used to
produce plutonium for nuclear weapons.
	   And one of Albright's missions, they say, will be to further
explore an idea raised in talks Kim had <TIMEX2 val="2000-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this summer</TIMEX2> with the
Russian president, Vladimir Putin, when Kim said he would reduce
the long-range missile program in exchange for foreign countries
launching North Korean satellites.
	   Negotiations over the North's support of terrorism are close to
bearing results as well, administration official argue. North Korea
remains on the State Department's list of countries that support
terrorism, a position that bars it from entering any of the
international financial institutions, including the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund. But the North Koreans have begun
to make the required steps that could soon remove them from the
terrorist list, the officials said.
	   Albright's visit comes on the heels of a series of moves by
North Korea to crack open the door to a society long closed and
allow the outside world a peek inside, maneuvers that have begun to
produce some benefits for Kim.
	   Britain announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-W42" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> that it would recognize North Korea,
and starting <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late last year</TIMEX2>, several Western countries, including
Italy and Australia, took up North Korea's invitation to open
diplomatic relations.
	   Still, most experts view the moves by the North Korean leader as
a way of ensuring the survival of his government, which rules over
one of the world's most impoverished and constrained populations.
