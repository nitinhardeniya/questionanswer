Wounded U.S. Sailors Reach Germany

	   LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) _ The 39 U.S. sailors injured in the
attack on a Navy ship in Yemen spent <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> at a hospital in this
idyllic corner of Germany _ some weeping, some taking to their beds
in exhaustion, all remembering their 17 shipmates who didn't make it
out.

	   The sailors arrived <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier Saturday</TIMEX2> at the Landstuhl Regional
Medical Center, the U.S. military hospital here, many for a <TIMEX2 val="P1D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-14" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">one-day</TIMEX2>
stay before heading back to the United States. They came to Germany
in two planeloads _ an initial 28 with mostly minor injuries,
followed by another 11 who were more seriously hurt.

	   ``They were definitely in shock,'' said Navy Lt. James Glaspie,
one of 11 military chaplains at the medical center to counsel the
survivors. Several sailors broke into tears when they called their
families back home after arriving at the hospital, chaplains said.
Many just wanted to sleep.

	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Two days earlier</TIMEX2>, the sailors were witness to the explosion that
claimed their colleagues: The 17 men and women died when a blast tore
a hole in the side of their ship, the USS Cole, while it refueled in
the Yemeni port of Aden. U.S. officials believe the attack was the
work of suicide bombers who blew up a small boat next to the
destroyer.

	   ``Some of them are still going through some emotional trauma from
the death of their fellow sailors,'' hospital director Col. Elder
Granger said of the wounded.

	   One young sailor with severe leg injuries told chaplains he
fought to survive, clambering up a ladder as water poured into the
ship. His wife was pregnant and ``he wanted to see the baby,''
Glaspie said.

	   He said a young woman officer _ the sole officer among the
injured _ was tormented by having to leave those under her command
behind. ``She was more concerned about her people than about
herself,'' Glaspie said.

	   Granger said 34 of the injured were cleared to return home
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, while five others would stay longer to be treated for serious
injuries _ one with a punctured lung, another with burns to face and
hands, and three with multiple broken bones. All were in stable
condition, he said.

	   Landstuhl is set amid rolling hills and fir forests near the
French border. The hospital has often served as a way station for
injured American military personnel on their way home. On <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>,
U.S. and German flags flew at half-staff at the entrance.

	   Officials refused to identify the sailors and kept them isolated
from the media, explaining that many had indicated they were still
too distressed to talk in public.

	   Before heading to the hospital, the wounded landed <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early Saturday</TIMEX2>
at Rhein-Main Air Base outside Frankfurt. Many in the first group to
arrive still wore shorts and T-shirts, wrapping themselves in
blankets against the chilly fog as they descended from the C9 medical
transport that had carried them on a <TIMEX2 val="PT15H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-14" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="ending early on 2000-10-14; there's no way to put a MOD on an ANCHOR_VAL">15-hour</TIMEX2> trip from Aden, Yemen.

	   Some had bandages around their heads. Two had eye bandages, and
four or five with bandaged limbs hopped on one foot without the aid
of crutches.

	   Not long after, another military transport left Ramstein to bring
home the bodies of five of the sailors killed in the bombing. The
caskets later arrived at the air force base in Dover, Del.
