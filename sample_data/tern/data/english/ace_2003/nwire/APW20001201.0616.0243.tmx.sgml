What Fox's Inauguration Means

	   Mexico has never had a peaceful transfer of power. After the
Mexican Revolution <TIMEX2 val="1900" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a century ago</TIMEX2>, feuding factions battled for power
until they were all drawn together in a single political party, known
as the PRI.

	   The PRI has ruled Mexico since its <TIMEX2 val="1929" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1929</TIMEX2> creation, never letting
another party grow into a threat, and using fraud in the rare cases
when one did. Over <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past 20 years</TIMEX2>, it has gradually ceded to
pressure to make the electoral process more fair.

	   Still, it was a shock when Vicente Fox of the conservative
National Action Party won the presidency on <TIMEX2 val="2000-07-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July 2</TIMEX2>. The PRI fell into
a deep crisis; the security guards around the party's heavily guarded
headquarters simply walked away.

	   Nobody knows what Fox will find after <TIMEX2 val="P71Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">71 years of single-party
rule</TIMEX2>. Under the PRI, corruption has run rampant throughout Mexico.
Political scandals usually have been handled behind closed doors.

	   Fox's election raises hopes for a new openness and a crackdown on
corruption. He also promises economic growth, educational reform and
more intense relations with the United States.

	   But he faces tremendous obstacles as well. There is no majority
in either house of Congress, and Fox concedes that the forces that
have grown powerful over <TIMEX2 val="P7DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">seven decades</TIMEX2> are waiting to pounce.
