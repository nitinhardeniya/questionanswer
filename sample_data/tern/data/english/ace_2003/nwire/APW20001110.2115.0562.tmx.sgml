Kursk Sinking Probe Continues
</HEADLINE>

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The controversy over what caused the
sinking of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk bubbled to the surface
again, with Russia's top soldier saying NATO was still a suspect and
the alliance's military chief again denying any NATO involvement.

	   Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the Russian general staff, told
reporters <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> he had asked NATO military chiefs of staff to
prove the alliance's claim that none of its submarines was
responsible for the Kursk tragedy by allowing Russian experts to
inspect NATO submarines.

	   On <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, the chief of NATO's Military Committee, Adm. Guido
Venturoni, issued another in a long line of NATO denials, saying the
alliance was not involved in the Kursk tragedy. He added that what
the Russian general told reporters and what he actually said in the
meeting with chiefs of staff were different.

	   ``I was not there when Gen. Kvashnin spoke (to reporters) but I
know exactly what he said in the meeting,'' the Italian admiral said.
Venturoni said Kvashnin told NATO's top soldiers that Moscow still
``had doubts,'' and that those doubts could have been eliminated if
the alliance had given a clear response when Russia first asked about
its submarines in the area.

	   Venturoni cited NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson's letter to
the Russian ambassador in Brussels shortly after the accident
affirming that no NATO assets were involved in the Kursk incident.
Russian President Vladimir Putin also received assurances from
President Clinton, Venturoni said.

	   He added: ``As a military man, as an admiral, as a naval officer
... if we speak of a submarine of 18,000 tons of weight, with a
double hull ... that we say has suffered major damage or a kind of
devastation by hitting some object ... I think that object would
receive a similar extent of damage.''

	   Russian naval officials have insisted on lifting the submarine to
determine what caused the <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug. 12</TIMEX2> explosions aboard the Kursk.
Russian and Norwegian divers have recovered 12 bodies so far and some
of the ship's documents.

	   Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is leading the
government commission investigating the disaster, said a dent filmed
on the Kursk's hull during the recovery operation may be evidence of
a collision with a foreign vessel.

	   Venturoni, speaking to reporters after a <TIMEX2 val="P2D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-10" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">two-day</TIMEX2> NATO chiefs of
staff meeting in Brussels, said NATO itself has no submarines, only
NATO members have submarines.

	   ``NATO has already answered (the Russian queries) through the
secretary-general,'' he said. ``It is not in my power nor in the
power of the Military Committee to agree on an inspection on a
submarine that belongs to a NATO nation, be it French or Dutch or
whatever it is.''
