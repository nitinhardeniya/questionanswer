Guilty Plea in Japan Spy Case

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former Japanese naval officer pleaded guilty
Monday to charges that he leaked defense secrets _ including
information about U.S. naval units in Japan _ to a Russian military
attache.

	   Shigehiro Hagisaki, 38, formerly a lieutenant commander with the
Maritime Self-Defense Force, made the plea at the Tokyo District
Court, a court spokesman said on condition of anonymity.

	   Hagisaki was arrested on Sept. 8 at a Tokyo restaurant after he
handed Capt. Victor Bogatenkov copies of a classified training manual
used by senior Maritime Self-Defense Force officers and papers
regarding plans for military communications systems, according to
police.

	   Bogatenkov, 44, was an official at the Russian Embassy in Tokyo.

	   Hagisaki is also suspected of handing over other defense secrets
_ including the information about U.S. naval units _ to Bogatenkov on
several occasions starting in September 1999.

	   Beginning this past March, Hagisaki received about $900 each time
he met with the Russian attache, Kyodo News agency said, citing
unidentified government investigators.

	   The report did not say if he received money before March.

	   Citing diplomatic immunity, Bogatenkov left Japan one day after
Hagisaki's arrest and has refused to speak to Japanese prosecutors.

	   Hagisaki, who worked as a researcher at Japan's National
Institute for Defense Studies, was stripped of his military
commission in October.

	   On Monday, in his first court appearance, he apologized to the
Japanese people for his actions, Kyodo said.

	   The crime of which he is accused carries a surprisingly light
penalty in Japan.

	   If found guilty of leaking classified information, the ex-naval
officer faces up to one year in prison or a fine of $270.
