Yugoslavia Threatens Albanian Rebels

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia called Monday on the U.N.
Security Council to set a deadline for ethnic Albanian rebels to
leave the buffer zone along the boundary with Kosovo, warning that
otherwise Belgrade would remove them.

	   The threat by the federal government followed a meeting of the
Yugoslav Supreme Defense Council, comprising the country's top
leaders and military commanders.

	   The government urged the U.N. body, which is overseeing the
administration of Kosovo, to amend the agreement that ended last
year's NATO bombing campaign and established a three-mile security
zone between the province and the rest of Serbia.

	   The Supreme Defense Council did not specify those proposed
changes. However, new Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica recently
suggested narrowing the three-mile buffer zone to make it easier to
control.

	   In its statement, the Yugoslav defense council said the changes
were needed ``because Albanian terrorists are using that zone to
threaten security in that area and outside it.''

	   In a separate statement, the Yugoslav federal government urged
the Security Council to set the ``shortest possible'' deadline for
militants to withdraw from the zone, or ``Yugoslavia will alone
resolve that problem by implementing all internationally allowed
methods of fighting against terrorism.''

	   The buffer zone was established in June 1999 before NATO-led
peacekeepers and a U.N. mission took control of Kosovo. It was
created to prevent the Yugoslav army from threatening allied forces
in the province.

	   Serbian police patrols are allowed into the buffer zone with
light arms only _ a fact that has enabled ethnic Albanian rebels to
operate with near impunity in the area. NATO-led peacekeepers are not
permitted to cross the border to pursue them there either.

	   Last month, the ethnic Albanians launched an offensive that
claimed the lives of four Serb policemen.

	   Late Monday, Serbian authorities announced that four Serbs
reported missing in the zone over the weekend were released unharmed
by ethnic Albanian militants. The official Tanjug news agency said
the four were freed Monday evening thanks to efforts by the Kosovo
peacekeeping command and Yugoslav authorities, but it gave no further
details.

	   The men, between 17 and 26 years old, were traveling by car to
spend Christmas with families in Gnjilane, a Kosovo town in the U.S.
zone 30 miles southeast of the capital, Pristina.

	   In Bujanovac, a town just on the edge of the buffer zone and
inside Serbia proper, Serb police sources told reporters that ethnic
Albanian militants Monday erected their own checkpoint outside the
nearby village of Veliki Trnovac. The rebels were reportedly checking
the identity of all travelers passing through the village.
