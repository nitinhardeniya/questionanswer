	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ Russian and Norwegian divers on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>
recovered several more bodies from the sunken Russian nuclear
submarine Kursk, the navy said.

	   The divers worked through <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the night</TIMEX2> inside the eighth and ninth
compartments of the submarine, searching for more of the 118 men
killed when the Kursk was shattered by an explosion and sank on <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug.
12</TIMEX2>. Several of the sailors were found and retrieved, said Vadim
Serga, the Northern Fleet spokesman.

	   The number of bodies and their identities remained unclear, he
said, apparently because the remains were badly damaged. Four other
bodies had already been pulled out <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>.

	   The divers struggled <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> to cut a hole through the hull
above the Kursk's ninth compartment, at the very stern of the
submarine, but the thick rubber and steel would not yield, Serga
said. Divers were forced to enter through a hole they had cut earlier
in the eighth compartment and grope their way back into the ninth
compartment through silt concealing jagged edges of mangled metal
inside the Kursk.

	   After <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-29" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">days of heavy winds and snowfall</TIMEX2>, skies over the Arctic
rescue site cleared enough <TIMEX2 val="2000-W43-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this weekend</TIMEX2> to allow helicopters to bring
the four bodies recovered <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> to the town of Severomorsk for a
mourning ceremony.

	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, speaking at the service where
caskets containing the remains of the four were placed atop armored
personnel carriers, said the cause of the disaster must be found to
avoid any repetition of the sinking. He said the Kursk crew was the
best in Russia's submarine fleet.

	   ``The crew loved the Motherland, the sea and the fleet. They
inherited the best of the navy's traditions,'' Sergeyev said. ``They
understood the need to serve their country and carried out their
duty. Forgive us and farewell.''

	   Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said the remains of all the
crew members would be recovered and the submarine itself will be
raised from the floor of the Barents Sea.

	   He said the cause of the sinking will be found, and the families
of the crew will be the first to know.

	   Many Russians have questioned the need for the risky, expensive
recovery effort. It has revived the emotional debate over how Russian
authorities handled the accident, including the <TIMEX2 val="P2D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-08-12" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">two-day</TIMEX2> delay in
announcing the accident and longer wait before accepting foreign help
in the failed rescue attempt.

	   ``Maybe they shouldn't have retrieved the bodies,'' Russian
Orthodox priest Daniil Topolev, who served the first liturgy for the
Kursk sailors after the accident, said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>. ``You can compare
this to as if people have been already buried, and then uncovered
again.''

	   Officials had found a note in the pocket of one of the recovered
submariners saying that 23 sailors had remained trapped alive in the
ninth compartment for <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-08-12" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">at least several hours after the powerful
explosions that sank the submarine <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug. 12</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>.

	   Topolev, speaking on the grounds of his small church in the
Barents port of Murmansk, near Severomorsk, said the fact that some
of the sailors did not die immediately was significant in Orthodox
tradition.

	   ``They had <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time to repent</TIMEX2>. That's already good. Those who died at
once, maybe they had <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time to cross themselves and say: Lord, save us</TIMEX2>.
And those who remained, could repent,'' he said.

	   The cause of the disaster has not been determined. Russian
officials have focused on the theory that the blasts were set off by
a collision with another, possibly foreign, ship. But others have
said the most likely cause was a torpedo exploding in its tube.
