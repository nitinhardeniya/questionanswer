Palestinians Clash With Israelis

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a bitter cycle of retaliation, Palestinians
threw stones and firebombs at Israeli troops Tuesday after a night
when Israeli helicopter rained missiles on command centers of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement.

	   The Israeli assault was a response to the slayings of two Jews,
presumably by Palestinians.

	   In Tuesday's clashes, Palestinians attacked Israeli troops at
several sites in the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops responded with
gunfire, killing a 17-year-old Palestinian and leaving another man
brain dead, Palestinian doctors said.

	   A journalist _ Ben Wedeman, 41, the CNN bureau chief in Cairo _
was shot in the back at the Karni crossing and was in stable
condition, hospital and CNN officials said. It was not immediately
clear who shot him.

	   On the political front, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak worked
Tuesday to build a political alliance with the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party, while prospects faded for a partnership with the hawkish Likud
faction.

	   For several weeks, Barak had sought to bring Likud leader Ariel
Sharon into his crumbling minority government. But contacts broke
down Monday night after the prime minister refused to grant Likud a
veto right over future peace talks.

	   An angry Sharon said Barak could no longer be trusted.

	   ``Apparently, he is not fit to lead the country,'' said Sharon,
whose Sept. 28 visit to a contested Jerusalem shrine was cited by the
Palestinians as a trigger for Israeli-Palestinian fighting.

	   Since that day, more than 140 people, the vast majority
Palestinians, have been killed in daily confrontations.

	   Israel unleashed its helicopter gunships late Monday after the
shooting death of an Israeli security guard in an Arab area of
Jerusalem and the stabbing death of an Israeli resident of Gilo, a
Jewish neighborhood.

	   Arafat said the helicopter raids would not break the resolve of
young Palestinian activists, ``these children who throw the stones to
defend Jerusalem, the Muslims and the holy places.''

	   The Palestinian leader toured one of the sites damaged by the
helicopter attacks _ a base for his bodyguards in Khan Yunis, in
Gaza. He accused Israel of destroying the peace process.

	   ``What happened here and elsewhere in the Palestinian territories
will not shake one hair on the head of the Palestinian children,'' he
said.

	   In Nablus, the largest West Bank town, Palestinians fired into
the air when they heard the roar of helicopters late Monday night,
but failed to prevent the gunships from sending two missiles into the
Fatah office in the city.

	   Next door to the Fatah office, Israeli machine-gun fire also
damaged the temple and offices of the biblical Samaritans, followers
of an offshoot of Judaism. About 600 Samaritans live in two
communities, one in Nablus and one in Israel.

	   Samaritan leaders said Israeli troops were aware of the shrine
when they opened fire. ``This is a sacred place and they should
respect it,'' said temple caretaker Fathi Abu Hassan.

	   Col. Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for the Israeli army, said Israel
fired warning shots first in order not to injure civilians.

	   Gunships also strafed Fatah offices in the West Bank town of El
Bireh, injuring five people, witnesses said.

	   Barak's chief police adviser, Danny Yatom, said the rocket
attacks were intended as a warning to Fatah, whose gunmen have taken
the lead in shooting attacks on Israeli targets. ``We are trying to
signal to the Palestinians that we know who is responsible,'' Yatom
told Israel's Army radio Tuesday.

	   Monday night's attack was one of the most intense by Israel in 34
days of fighting.

	   Mideast peace talks are on hold, and one obstacle to renewed
negotiations has been the political instability in Israel. Barak's
problems became more urgent Monday when parliament reconvened after a
three-month recess.

	   Barak lost his parliamentary majority over the summer when three
factions quit his coalition to protest concessions he was preparing
to make to the Palestinians at a Mideast summit in July at the U.S.
presidential retreat at Camp David.

	   One of the defectors, Shas, agreed this week to grant Barak a
parliamentary safety net for a month, meaning he can maneuver without
fear of being toppled.

	   However, Shas leader Eli Ishai announced Tuesday that his party
was not giving Barak unconditional support.

	   ``The Camp David understandings are dead,'' Ishai told Army
radio, adding that if Barak revives the Israeli proposals made at the
summit, ``he doesn't have a safety net.''

	   Shas, the third largest party in parliament with 17 of 120
lawmakers, is generally hawkish, but its top priority has been to
secure funding for its financially strapped network of private
schools.
