	   ABOARD THE USS TRUMAN (AP) _ American officials are on guard
against possible terrorist attacks during <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the holiday season</TIMEX2>, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>.

	   Cohen was aboard the aircraft carrier USS Truman off the Italian
coast, the first stop of a <TIMEX2 val="P4D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-16" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">four-day</TIMEX2> trip to visit U.S. troops in
Italy and the Balkans.

	   ``We're trying to anticipate whether or not there will be any
action that might coincide with <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of Ramadan</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the beginning
of our Christmas holidays</TIMEX2>,'' the outgoing defense secretary said.
``It is <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="vague duration">a period</TIMEX2> that we watch very closely.''

	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Earlier this month</TIMEX2>, Cohen authorized the deployment of extra Navy
and Coast Guard personnel in the Persian Gulf, stepping up security
in the aftermath of the <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 12</TIMEX2> terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in
Yemen that killed 17 sailors.

	   Cohen also said that the transformation of the U.S. military into
a ``more rapidly deployable, lighter and more sustainable'' force is
``irreversible,'' and that the new administration led by
President-elect George W. Bush will have to follow the same path.

	   ``These initiatives are essential if we're going to transform the
force that we had in <TIMEX2 val="19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 20th century</TIMEX2> into one of <TIMEX2 val="20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 21st century</TIMEX2>,''
Cohen said. ``I don't see any prospects of them fading away.''

	   Cohen said such a force would be better equipped against the
challenges the United States and Europe will confront in <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the upcoming
years</TIMEX2>, such as transnational terrorism, the use of chemical and
biological weapons and political instability.

	   Cohen was on his fourth and last tour of U.S. troops abroad.

	   ``It is the most exhausting job one could possibly ever have,''
he said of his tenure as defense secretary, addressing hundreds of
soldiers in the ship's hangar. ``It's also the most rewarding.''

	   Accompanying Cohen on his visit to the carrier was his wife,
Janet, and a lineup of celebrities that include football
Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw and the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.

	   The Truman is a new, nuclear-powered vessel on its first
deployment. It carries a crew of 5,000.
