	   WASHINGTON _ If the man accused of killing seven people near
Boston on Tuesday got his guns in Massachusetts, he was able to
skirt some of the strictest regulations in the country, people
familiar with the state's laws said Wednesday.
	   Investigators said Wednesday that the suspect, Michael
McDermott, did not have a permit for any of the four weapons he
took with him to work. Without the permits, he was breaking
Massachusetts law just by having the weapons.
	   The state requires a permit, formally known as a ``firearm
identification card,'' for purchase of virtually every kind of
firearm, whether for personal protection or hunting. An additional
permit, which may specify restrictions, is needed to carry a
concealed weapon.
	   Identification cards are issued by the local police and may take
up to 30 days to obtain while an applicant's background is checked.
Even if a background check turns up no convictions for serious
crimes, which would make it all but impossible for an applicant to
get a card, the police have considerable discretion on whether to
issue them.
	   While investigators said they did not yet know where the
Massachusetts-born suspect got his guns, Scott Harshbarger, the
former state attorney general who pushed for more stringent state
gun-control rules in the late 1990s, said, ``This is where you'll
see if the tracing system works.''
	   A recent federal study showed that up to 70 percent of guns
found to have been used in crimes in Boston actually came from out
of state, especially Georgia, Virginia and other Southern states,
Daniel Webster, an assistant professor of health policy at the
Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said Wednesday.
	   Violations of the Massachusetts laws carry fines of several
thousand dollars and up to 10 years in prison.
	   Webster said other states closer to Massachusetts, notably
Vermont and New Hampshire, have looser gun regulations than
Massachusetts, a view Harshbarger did not dispute.
	   The authorities said McDermott used a 12-gauge shotgun and an
``AK-47 style'' semiautomatic rifle to kill his co-workers, and
that he was also carrying a semiautomatic handgun. Investigators
later found a .460 Magnum rifle with a telescopic sight in the
suspect's locker at work.
	   A true AK-47, which can fire ``fully automatic'' like a machine
gun, is classified as an assault weapon under Massachusetts as well
as federal law, and a state permit would be difficult if not
impossible to obtain, Harshbarger said, while a semiautomatic rifle
(one shot per trigger pull) modeled after an AK-47 might be
permissible.
	   Massachusetts, like many states, requires a special permit to
carry a handgun.
	   The .460 Magnum, manufactured by Weatherby Inc. of Atascadero,
Calif., is a bolt-action rifle and one of the most powerful
shoulder-fired weapons in the world. It is ``the only choice for
Africa's most dangerous game,'' according to the manufacturer.
	   A top-of-the-line .460 Magnum can cost close to $6,000. While it
is not illegal to own one in Massachusetts, there is no big game in
that state _ and probably none in North America _ that demands its
stopping power. A longtime Virginia gun dealer said Wednesday he
had sold two in the past five years, and that its recoil is simply
too punishing for many shooters.
	   In many states, a person can buy a 12-gauge shotgun, a widely
used hunting weapon, as easily as a fishing rod. But in
Massachusetts, a shotgun purchase requires a firearm identification
card.
	   Harshbarger, who is now president and chief executive of Common
Cause, a lobbying organization, said the slaughter in Wakefield
``shows that even the toughest laws can't prevent every type of
tragedy.''
