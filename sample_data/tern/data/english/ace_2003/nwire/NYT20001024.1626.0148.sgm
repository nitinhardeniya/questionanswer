BANKS SET UP GLOBAL GUIDELINES TO COMBAT DIRTY MONEY

	   GENEVA _ A group of major international banks, stung by the
growing reputation of the banking industry as a haven for
ill-gotten gains, are pledging to form a global front against money
laundering.
	   They plan to issue guidelines to toughen their practices to shut
off dirty- money deposits by organized crime and corrupt political
leaders. While the details will not be released until next week, a
significant provision in the new code of conduct will require banks
to bring the activities of offshore banking subsidiaries' in line
with tougher rules on financial crime.
	   Switzerland's largest bank, UBS, is leading the effort, which
will initially be joined by a group of banks from the Netherlands,
Spain, England, Germany, France and Hong Kong.
	   Starting in the 1980s, when President Ferdinand Marcos of the
Philippines deposited more than $500 million in Swiss accounts,
major banks have repeatedly disclosed that they have accepted
deposits from dictators. The latest cases involve former Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and the late Nigerian leader Sani
Abacha. Swiss officials say Milosevic and associates have deposited
more than $57 million in accounts here.
	   Abacha's deposits, which totaled more than $670 million in banks
in Switzerland, were a particular embarrassment because they came
after stricter money laundering rules were established. Swiss
banking regulators publicly scolded six banks, including Credit
Suisse and two of its subsidiaries, for accepting questionable
Nigerian deposits.
	   Dr. Mark Pieth, a money laundering expert who helped draft the
new code, said the rules would be tougher than those already
adopted by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force to single
out countries that do not effectively guard against money
laundering.
	   ``We can issue blacklists, but short of closing a bank down,
what can you do?'' Pieth asked. He said tough regulations could end
the practice of companies setting aside offshore bank accounts to
bribe foreign officials. ``It's not just money laundering,'' he
said, but the banks want to prevent people from using banks for
illegal ends.
	   The banks that have signed on include UBS; Credit Suisse;
ABN-Amro of the Netherlands; Banco Santander of Spain; Barclays
Bank of Britain; Deutsche Bank and its New York-based Bankers Trust
unit; HSBC of Hong Kong; and Societe Generale of France. Three U.S.
banks, Chase Manhattan and its merger partner J.P. Morgan and
Citibank, which was involved in moving about $100 million for Raul
Salinas de Gortari, brother of a former Mexican president, to banks
in Switzerland, are also expected to sign on, according to UBS.
	   The guidelines, named Wolfsberg after a UBS training center,
were drawn up with Transparency International, an anti-corruption
organization.
