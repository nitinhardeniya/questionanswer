	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain and North Korea agreed Tuesday to establish
diplomatic relations _ recognition, Britain said, of Pyongyang's
warming relationship with South Korea and its decision to suspend
missile launches.

	   The decision marks the first time Britain has had diplomatic ties
with the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea since its
creation 50 years ago.

	   In a sign of its improving relations with the outside world,
North Korea has this year already established diplomatic links with
Canada, Italy and Austria.

	   Britain said in October that it was ready to follow suit, and
Tuesday's announcement came after five days of talks in London
between government officials.

	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the decision ``was
taken in recognition of the significant progress'' in the dialogue
between the two Koreas, particularly a landmark June summit between
their leaders, Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung.

	   South Korea's Foreign Ministry welcomed Tuesday's decision,
saying it ``will not only improve relations between the two
countries, but also play a positive role in building peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula through inter-Korean reconciliation
and cooperation.''

	   Cook also praised ongoing communication between the United States
and North Korea, as well as the communist country's moratorium on
missile launches.

	   ``We believe that dialogue and negotiation are the best ways of
securing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,'' Cook said.

	   In a joint statement, the two governments said they would appoint
ambassadors after arranging for permanent mission offices in London
and Pyongyang.
