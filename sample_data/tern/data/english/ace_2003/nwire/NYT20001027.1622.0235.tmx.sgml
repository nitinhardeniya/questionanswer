	   SEOUL, South Korea _ It is impossible for any outsider to know
exactly why North Korea has changed its tack so dramatically in
<TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent months</TIMEX2>, inviting old enemies from South Korea and the United
States to Pyongyang and toasting them lavishly.
	   But it was clear on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> that the North Korean leader, Kim
Jong Il, had impressed his long-skeptical guests as someone
Washington could work with when, during one of his country's
massively choreographed extravaganzas, he made a quip to Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright about cooperation on missiles.
	   The reasons guessed at for North Korea's campaign range from
sheer distress because of repeated famines and a collapsing
economy, to a push from the country's Chinese benefactors, who are
eager to remove North Korea and its weapons programs from
Washington's list of justifications for developing high-tech
missile shields.
	   But for all the attention to the reception given to Albright,
<TIMEX2 val="2000-W43" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2>'s scenes of conciliation and good cheer were merely the
latest in a gradually accelerating transformation that has been
under way for <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">at least a year</TIMEX2>.
	   North Korea has been on a diplomatic blitz for <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-27T17:06:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="for 'a full year' I wanted to use year as the granulation, but for 'now' I wanted to use the more precise version. should this be two tags?">a full year <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-27T17:06:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>,
establishing or planning relations with Britain, Canada, Australia,
Italy, France and others. ``Meeting with North Korean officials
used to be like watching a man try to cross a river by feeling the
rocks under his feet one by one,'' said a diplomat from one of
these countries. ``The only thing is that whenever the North
Koreans reached a rock, you could never be sure they wanted to
proceed any further.''
	   ``<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-27T17:06:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Nowadays</TIMEX2>,'' the diplomat said, ``you walk into a meeting with
them for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the first time</TIMEX2>, and before you can even get acquainted,
they are saying, `Great, how quickly can we establish relations.'''
	   The cynical view of this diplomatic offensive is that it merely
seeks to collect as much international aid as possible for
Pyongyang, while diversifying the sources. Just as surely, though,
these new engagements will quickly increase the exposure of people
inside the world's most reclusive nation to outsiders and their
influences _ a risky proposition, which perhaps explains why such
an opening has not been tried before.
	   In a system like North Korea's, in which power is highly
concentrated and closely held, that such changes are taking place
certainly reflects decisions made at the summit of power. But it is
just as clear that few of the changes have been explained to people
from the upper-middle level of the bureaucracy on down.
	   <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-27T17:06:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>, suddenly, people in a nation that, with China's help,
fought the United States to a standstill in the Korean War, and
have been told all their lives that Americans are wolves, are
seeing their leaders making merry with the enemy.
	   ``Why are people suddenly so cooperative?'' said one Western
diplomat whose country is planning to open relations soon with
Pyongyang. ``Because they know the instructions have come from the
chairman to smile and get as much help from the outside as
possible, and they know they'd better not fail. But boy are they
confused.''
	   The confusion theme was repeated by almost every Westerner with
extensive experience in North Korea. ``Decisions in a pyramidal
society like this are so centralized, so political and so personal,
that it is hard for Americans to understand that kind of
pressure,'' said Peter Hayes, co-executive director of the Nautilus
Institute, a private aid group that has been active in the country
for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">years</TIMEX2>.
	   ``Many people are confused,'' Hayes said. ``They don't know what
the new edicts from the top mean. Those at the top might not even
know. They are striking out in a completely new direction, and they
are going to have to make it up as they go along.'' But frequent
visitors say that given the sheer weight of the country's
totalitarian ideology and generations of mass indoctrination,
changing this country's course will be something akin to turning a
huge ship at sea.
	   Opening North Korea up, even modestly, and exposing people to
the idea that Westerners _ and South Koreans _ are not devils,
alone represents an extraordinary change. It also represents a
fantastic gambit.
	   The foremost task <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-27T17:06:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> for Kim is to make sure that the change
does not become revolutionary, as his people begin to get a clearer
idea of the deprivation they have suffered, especially relative to
their neighbors.
	   ``This is a society that has been focused most of all on
stability, and they have been guided all along by a stable
ideology,'' said one international aid worker who has visited the
country often. ``If you talk to officials there <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-27T17:06:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, though,
suddenly they feel like they are being carried along by a wave, and
to say the least, they are perplexed.''
