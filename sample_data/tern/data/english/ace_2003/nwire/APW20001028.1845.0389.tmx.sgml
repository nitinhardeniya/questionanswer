Kursk Submarine Recovery Resumes

	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ As the skies cleared and the sea calmed,
Norwegian divers started carving a new hole in the Russian nuclear
submarine Kursk on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> in a tricky mission to recover more of
the 118 men killed when it sank.

	   A fierce storm on the Arctic site of the Barents Sea forced the
suspension of the operation <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>. But the wind lessened <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-27TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">overnight</TIMEX2>
and divers began heading down to the submarine, said Vladimir
Navrotsky, spokesman for the Russian Navy's northern fleet.

	   The divers worked through <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> to cut a hole through the
thick rubber covering the submarine and the outer hull above the
Kursk's ninth compartment. Weather permitting, Navrotsky said the
divers would likely cut through the thicker inner hull <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> and
venture inside soon afterward.

	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>'s work was being done only by Norwegian divers because
winds were still strong, Navrotsky said. Russian regulations prevent
Russian divers from resuming work until the waves are less than 12
feet.

	   Family members of the Kursk's crew waited anxiously <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> for
a helicopter to deliver the four bodies already recovered from the
diving site to the ship's home port of Severomorsk. The bodies were
pulled out <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> through a hole cut in the ship's eighth
compartment.

	   A memorial ceremony was initially planned for the four <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>
in Severomorsk, but it was postponed until <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> because the gale
prevented helicopters from bringing the four bodies ashore.

	   Winds had not calmed enough by <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-28TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday night</TIMEX2> for the trip,
prompting concerns that it would be put off again.

	   In a chilling discovery, officials found a note in the pocket of
one of the recovered submariners saying that 23 sailors had remained
trapped alive in the ninth compartment for <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-08-12" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">at least several hours</TIMEX2>
after the powerful explosions that sank the submarine <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug. 12</TIMEX2>.

	   Many Russians have questioned the need for the risky, expensive
recovery effort. It has revived the emotional debate over how Russian
authorities handled the accident, including the <TIMEX2 val="P2D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-08-12" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">two-day</TIMEX2> delay in
announcing the accident and a longer wait before accepting foreign
help in the failed rescue attempt.

	   ``Maybe they shouldn't have retrieved the bodies,'' Russian
Orthodox priest Daniil Topolev said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>. ``You can compare this
to as if people have already been buried, and then uncovered again.''

	   Topolev, speaking on the grounds of his small church in the
Barents port of Murmansk, near Severomorsk, said the fact that some
of the sailors did not die immediately was significant in Orthodox
tradition.

	   ``They had <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time to repent</TIMEX2>. That's already good. Those who died at
once, maybe they had <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time to cross themselves and say: Lord, save us</TIMEX2>.
And those who remained, could repent,'' he said.

	   The cause of the disaster has not been determined. Russian
officials have focused on the theory that the blasts were set off by
a collision with another, possibly foreign, ship. But others have
said the most likely cause was a torpedo exploding in its tube.
