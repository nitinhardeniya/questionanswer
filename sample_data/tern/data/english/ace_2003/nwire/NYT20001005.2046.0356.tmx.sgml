	   MEXICO CITY _ A hurricane that has lashed four Central American
nations for <TIMEX2 val="P1W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W39" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">a week</TIMEX2>, killing at least a dozen people and driving
tens of thousands from their homes, struck Mexico's Gulf coast with
90-mile-an-hour winds <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, the National Hurricane Center in
Miami said.
	   In Belize alone the storm has caused about $200 million in
damage, according to Belize government officials.
	   In and around the city of Tampico, Mexico, where the storm made
landfall <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday afternoon</TIMEX2>, winds were gusting to 94 miles <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XXTXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">an
hour</TIMEX2>, and officials were trying to evacuate low-lying areas. More
than 1,500 people had been displaced by the time the storm hit,
Mexico's civil defense agency said.
	   Almost all of Mexico's gulf ports were closed by the storm.
Cities, towns and villages in a 340-mile swath of the coast were
bracing for 8 inches to 10 inches of rain. Three dozen Mexican
cities and villages lay directly in the path of the storm, the
authorities said.
	   The National Hurricane Center said that the rain threatened to
cause flash floods and mudslides, and that waves of up to 5 feet
would hit Mexico's Gulf coast throughout <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday night</TIMEX2>.
	   The center predicted that the storm would weaken rapidly as it
moved northwest over Mexico.
	   During <TIMEX2 val="2000-W39" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the past week</TIMEX2>, the storm has pounded Mexico and three
Central American nations, hitting hardest in Nicaragua and Belize
as it grew into a Category 4 hurricane over <TIMEX2 val="2000-W39-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the weekend</TIMEX2>, ebbed to a
tropical storm, then surged back to hurricane Category 1 strength.
	   In Belize, the government on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> issued an international
appeal for help, saying that 25,000 people, about one in 10
citizens, had been evacuated after the storm hit on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>. The
damage in Belize was estimated at $200 million, a figure equal to
roughly 45 percent of the nation's annual gross domestic product,
said Patrick Jones, the government's chief communications officer.
	   In Nicaragua, the storm led to at least 11 drownings and drove
at least 4,000 people from their homes. And from Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula down to Panama, homes were destroyed, bridges knocked out
and roads swept away by the rain and wind.
