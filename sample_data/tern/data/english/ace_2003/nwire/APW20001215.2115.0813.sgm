Putin: Prisoner's Release Goodwill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday he
pardoned U.S. businessman Edmond Pope as a ``goodwill gesture''
toward the United States and the incoming Bush administration.

	   Putin, who ordered Pope's release Thursday, said he hoped the
action would show that such cases do not have to damage relations
between the two nations.

	   ``I hope that a goodwill gesture made by Russia in relation to
Mr. Pope wouldn't hamper the development of bilateral relations,''
Putin told reporters during a state visit to Cuba.

	   The case, the first in 40 years in which an American was
convicted of spying in Russia, has raised questions about the growing
power of Russia's security services. Pope, who denied he was a spy,
was flown to Germany after his release.

	   Putin, a former KGB agent, defended the court that convicted Pope
and the security services, saying: ``The court sentence has clearly
and precisely shown Mr. Pope's guilt, and we have no doubt of the
fairness of the verdict.''

	   ``The activities of both intelligence and counterintelligence
services mustn't damage bilateral relations, and, especially, ties
between such major powers as Russia and the United States,'' Putin
said.

	   Putin also welcomed President-elect George W. Bush's new
administration.

	   ``We know the team surrounding the president-elect quite well,''
he said. ``It's a team of professionals who deeply know all
intricacies of relations between Russia and the United States.''
