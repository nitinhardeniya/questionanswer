	   DALLAS _ Texas officials approved a plan <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> to bring
Houston's runaway smog under control by reducing the speed limit on
the region's freeways and highways to 55 mph, requiring deep cuts
in emissions from refineries and other industrial plants, and
eventually banning use of heavy construction equipment during <TIMEX2 val="TMO" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
morning</TIMEX2> for <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="APPROX" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">much of the year</TIMEX2>.
	   Houston, which by some measures has overtaken Los Angeles as the
smoggiest city in the nation, has been under tremendous pressure to
reduce ozone emissions or face sanctions from the federal
government. The city is home to many petroleum refineries, and for
<TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">years</TIMEX2> it had largely ignored its growing smog problem as an
acceptable byproduct of a thriving economy.
	   Officials at the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission,
a three-member body that oversees state environmental regulations,
called the plan the most significant air quality proposal in Texas
history. The measures, which are intended to bring Houston into
compliance with federal clean-air standards by <TIMEX2 val="2007" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2007</TIMEX2>, will be
submitted to the federal Environmental Protection Agency <TIMEX2 val="2000-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this month</TIMEX2>
for approval.
	   One state commissioner, Ralph Marquez, called the plan a ``<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">new
era of clean air</TIMEX2>'' and said the state ``will continue to be as
flexible as possible, and we will continue to pursue improved
scientific knowledge, but we must get the job done.''
	   But the plan was attacked by environmentalists as falling far
short of what is needed. Ramon Alvarez, a scientist with the Texas
office of Environmental Defense, a private American group that has
focused on building environmental programs that have the support of
industries, said that while the plan would ``improve air quality,
it is not enough to protect public health.''
	   He also said it weakened ``previous positions endorsed by the
natural resources commission and includes ideas that are simply
unworkable'' and urged the EPA to reject the plan unless it was
strengthened.
	   Among other things, the plan calls for these steps:
	   _ Reducing the speed limit in the Houston area to 55 mph from as
high as 70 mph, beginning in <TIMEX2 val="2002-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May 2002</TIMEX2>.
	   _ Requiring a 90 percent cut in nitrogen oxide emissions from
major industrial sources.
	   _ Strengthening vehicle emissions testing in Harris County,
where Houston is situated, and surrounding counties.
	   _ Banning the use of heavy construction equipment and commercial
lawn mowers in Harris and four other counties from <TIMEX2 val="T06" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">6 a.m.</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="T12" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">noon</TIMEX2>
from <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-04" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="2005" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">April</TIMEX2> through <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-10" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="2005" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">October</TIMEX2>, beginning in <TIMEX2 val="2005" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2005</TIMEX2>.
	   George Beatty Jr., the president of the chamber of commerce
division of the Greater Houston Partnership, a leading business
group, praised the plan over all but said, ``We're a little
concerned with the restrictiveness of some of the actions.''
	   Beatty also said the plan gave Houston officials <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time to find
alternatives to the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XXTMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">morning</TIMEX2> ban on heavy construction equipment</TIMEX2>.
	   State environmental officials said the plan was expected to
reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide, a primary ingredient in the
creation of ozone, by 75 percent in the eight-county Houston
metropolitan area.
	   Roughly 55 percent of Houston's nitrogen oxide is produced by
industry, while 25 percent comes from automobiles and trucks and 20
percent from airplanes, trains, ships, lawn mowers and construction
equipment.
