	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Weather on the Barents Sea improved Saturday and
Russian and Norwegian divers resumed their search for bodies in the
sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a navy official said.

	   The divers cut an opening in the inner hull over a compartment
that served as the crew's living quarters, Northern Fleet spokesman
Capt. Vadim Serga said.

	   ``As weather reports predicted, surface conditions were much
improved this morning at the site of the disaster,'' allowing the
divers to resume their efforts to recover the bodies of the 118
sailors who died when the submarine exploded and sank Aug. 12, Serga
said.

	   He said the divers completed cutting a 4.8-inch opening in the
inner hull. A larger hole would be cut later to give the divers
access, he said.

	   High winds and snow Friday forced divers' to halt efforts to
recover bodies from the Kursk. So far, 12 bodies have been recovered,
all from the submarine's stern.

	   The divers moved their search toward less-damaged areas of the
vessel Friday, after failing to enter a shattered third forward
compartment.

	   Before work was suspended Friday, Serga said they hoped to find
more crew remains in the fourth compartment, which served as living
quarters for the crew. The compartment held bunks, a kitchen and a
room for meetings and social activity.

	   At least 23 sailors in the submarine's stern survived the initial
explosion, according to a letter found on the body of Lt. Dmitry
Kolesnikov. Eight have been identified so far.

	   The cause of the sinking remains unknown. Russian officials have
theorized that the Kursk collided with a foreign submarine, setting
off the powerful blasts. Others have suggested a technical
malfunction caused a torpedo to explode in its tube.
