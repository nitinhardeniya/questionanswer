Officials Shift Sub Salvage Efforts

	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ Russian naval officials have ordered
divers to shift their search for remains from the aft section of the
sunken nuclear submarine Kursk to its front, naval officials said
Tuesday.

	   The spokesman for the Russian Northern Fleet, Capt. Vladimir
Navrotsky, said officials judged a further search of the aft section
to be too risky. Divers had stopped their search of the submarine's
ninth compartment, he said.

	   ``The divers have done all they could,'' Navrotsky said.
``Further efforts would be too dangerous for the divers.''

	   However, he said there was still hope of recovering remains from
the front of the Kursk _ contradicting officials' earlier statements
that seamen there had almost certainly been blown to pieces when the
Kursk's weapons detonated in a powerful explosion, equal in force to
a 3.5-magnitude earthquake.

	   ``We believe there is still a chance of finding bodies in the
third compartment,'' Navrotsky said.

	   Others alleged that the search for bodies was a cover for
attempts to retrieve sensitive equipment and documents.

	   ``It goes without saying that first of all they are looking for
documents and secret equipment,'' said Mikhail Guzun, a retired naval
officer in the Arctic seaport of Murmansk. ``There is both machinery
and equipment that should not fall into foreigners' hands.''

	   Navrotsky denied that. Still, by moving to the front of the
submarine, naval officials may be hoping to gather clues on what
caused the Aug. 12 disaster that killed the Kursk's 118 crewmen.

	   Russian officials have focused on the theory that the blasts were
set off by a collision with another, possibly foreign, ship during
exercises in the Barents Sea. But others have said the most likely
cause was a torpedo exploding in its tube.

	   Teams of Russian and Norwegian divers have so far recovered 12
bodies. They focused their work in the stern after finding a seaman's
note indicating that at least 23 sailors had survived for hours after
the initial blasts that sank the sub. The survivors had gathered in
the ninth and last compartment, where the emergency escape hatch was
located, the note said.

	   In Moscow, navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said Tuesday that the
ninth compartment was too confined for the divers to continue their
work.

	   ``Minimum safe passages should be at least 70 centimeters (28
inches) wide. At present moment, they are 55 centimeters (22 inches)
wide, making further work too dangerous for the divers,'' Dygalo
said.

	   He said the divers had covered a hole they cut in the submarine's
hull over the eighth compartment with a special steel cover and also
shut the exit hatch in the ninth compartment, conserving the wreck.

	   Throughout the 10-day operation, the divers have been at risk of
ripping their pressure suits and air hoses on their machinery.

	   Meanwhile, the weather at the disaster site started to improve on
Tuesday, lifting hopes that the seamen's remains could be flown from
the divers' mother ship, Regalia, to the mainland for identification
and burial. The first four bodies were brought to shore for a
memorial ceremony on Sunday, but the others were stranded because bad
weather hampered helicopter flights.

	   Officials said Tuesday that forensic expertise had confirmed the
identity of Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, in whose pocket the note was
found. Kolesnikov's body was flown to his native city of St.
Petersburg for burial.

	   After more than two months underwater, the bodies have been
severely damaged, complicating identification, officials said. They
will not be released to relatives for burial until forensic experts
complete their work.
