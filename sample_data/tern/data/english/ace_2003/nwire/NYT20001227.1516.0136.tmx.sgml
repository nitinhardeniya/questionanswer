	   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Thailand's attempts to fight corruption
became more tangled <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> when an official on the country's new
anti-corruption commission admitted violating its financial
disclosure rules and resigned.
	   The resignation came <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">one day after the commission announced that
the leading candidate for prime minister in an election <TIMEX2 val="2001-W01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next week</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>
had similarly failed to disclose assets and should be disqualified
from holding office.
	   It heightened a debate over the powers of the commission, which
the candidate, Thaksin Shinawatra, asserts is placing itself ahead
of what he calls the will of the people in the parliamentary
election, scheduled for <TIMEX2 val="2001-01-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Jan. 6</TIMEX2>.
	   The National Counter Corruption Commission was created by a
liberal constitution <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three years ago</TIMEX2> as part of an attempt to
reform Thailand's money-driven political and electoral system. Its
tough rulings, along with those of a new Election Commission, have
drawn strong resistance from many old-style politicians.
	   The resignation of the commissioner, Preeya Kasemsant, followed
an accusation by a democracy advocate close to Thaksin that three
members of the commission failed to divest themselves of financial
holdings when they took office. A second commissioner denied the
accusation.
	   Preeya led the investigation that found wrongdoing by Thaksin
when he concealed some of his assets by transferring shares to his
household help.
	   ``She confessed to me that she forgot that she had shares in one
company,'' a commissioner, Wirat Wattanasiritham, said of Preeya.
	   Thaksin said <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> that he would proceed with his campaign and
take office if he wins, even if that meant that he might eventually
be forced to step down if he fails in an appeal to the
Constitutional Court.
	   The resignation of Preeya, and the possibility that other
commissioners might have broken full-disclosure rules, could boost
Thaksin's chances on appeal.
	   It could also open the door to challenges to other rulings by
the commission, particularly a finding <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this year</TIMEX2> that led
to a <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">five-year</TIMEX2> ban on political activity by a former interior
minister, Sanan Kachornprasart.
	   And it could blunt demands made by some newspapers and public
figures on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> that Thaksin withdraw from the campaign to
prevent a period of political uncertainty if he wins.
	   Thaksin, who heads his own new party, Thai Rak Thai, or Thai
Love Thai, is strongly favored by analysts to unseat the Democrat
Party headed by the incumbent prime minister, Chuan Leekpai.
	   The governing party has become widely unpopular after <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1997" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">three
years in power</TIMEX2>, and if Thaksin were to pull out, the contest for a
parliamentary majority after the election could become a
free-for-all.
