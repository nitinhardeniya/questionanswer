Naval Observatory Awaits Millennium

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Well, that was all great fun last New Year's.
But now, the U.S. Naval Observatory and others who can count are
getting ready to celebrate the actual arrival of the Third
Millennium.

	   At the stroke of midnight on Dec. 31 a time ball _ a traditional
naval messaging system _ will descend a mast on the roof of the
Observatory's main building, signaling the arrival of Jan. 1, 2001
and the new millennium in the United States.

	   Celebrations were widespread last New Year's Eve as people around
the world greeted the year 2000, happily watching the three zeros
line up and the end of the 1900s.

	   It wasn't really the end of the second millennium, though, since
a full two thousand years will be complete on Jan. 1, 2001.

	   Observatory spokesman Geoff Chester said the time experts are
organizing similar events in other places to mark the arrival of the
millennium as the new year sweeps around the world, starting at the
International Dateline in the Pacific Ocean.

	   He said similar events are planned at McMurdo Station,
Antarctica; Lyttelton, New Zealand; Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide,
Kangaroo Island, and Fremantle Australia; New Delhi, India; Cape
Town, South Africa; Goteborg and the Karslkrona Naval Base, Sweden;
Greenwich, England; Edinburgh, Scotland, and New York City, among
others.

	   The dropping of a time ball followed by a cannon shot was long
used by navies as a time marker to help ship captains set their
chronometers.

	   Accurate timekeeping is vital to navigation, though radio signals
and atomic clocks are used today in place of the older system.

	   Keeping time also involves knowing the date and Observatory
researchers, along with many other calendar experts, stress that the
new millennium begins Jan. 1, 2001.

	   ``This date is based on a now globally recognized calendar
established by the sixth-century scholar Dionysius Exiguus,''
according to the Observatory.

	   The problem: The concept of ``zero'' hadn't reached Europe at the
time, so he didn't include any year zero.

	   England's Royal Greenwich Observatory agrees and explains it this
way:

	   ``The question of, 'Which is the first year of the millennium?'
hinges on the date of the first year A.D. Unfortunately, the sequence
of years going from B.C. to A.D. does not include a year 0. The
sequence of years runs 3 B.C., 2 B.C., 1 B.C., A.D. 1, A.D. 2, A.D.
3, etc.

	   ``This means that the first year of the first millennium was 1
A.D. The one-thousandth year was A.D. 1000 and the first day of the
second millennium was A.D. 1001. It is thus clear that the start of
the new millennium will be 1 Jan. 2001.''

	   Adds Germany's federal physical-technical office: Since ``no year
zero exists ... the third millennium begins with the turn of the year
2000 to 2001.''

	   About 1,500 years ago the monk Dionysius Exiguus _ Dennis the
Short _ was directed to compile tables of dates to help local priests
and bishops work out the correct date for Easter.

	   Little is known of him, described as a native Scythian, but he
had a great reputation as a mathematician and scholar in Rome and was
asked by Pope John I to help with Easter. He went well beyond that.

	   The calendar used then to calculate Easter dated from the
accession of the Roman emperor Diocletian in the year now called A.D.
284.

	   But Diocletian had persecuted early Christians, and Dionysius
said in a letter he ``preferred to count and denote the years from
the incarnation of our Lord.''

	   He calculated that Jesus' birth had occurred 532 years earlier.

	   Dionysius called the year of Jesus' birth the year ''1'' and
began counting.

	   The first decade was 1 to 10, the second was 11 to 20, and so
forth.

	   Extrapolating, the second millennium ends with completion of the
year 2000, and the third millennium starts with 2001.

	   At the time, in the Western world, counting was done with either
Roman numerals or fingers, neither of which includes zero.

	   The Arabic system of numbers, which does include zero and is now
nearly universal, appears to have originated in India, where zero
came into use about A.D. 600. The system was adopted by Arab traders,
who brought it to Spain and eventually all of Europe.

	   Today, many scholars believe Dionysius actually miscalculated
Jesus' birth by three to five years, but it's unlikely the calendar
will be changed again.
