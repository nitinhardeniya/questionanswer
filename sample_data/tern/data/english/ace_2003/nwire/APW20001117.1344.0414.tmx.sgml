	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ ``Darkness in El Dorado'' earned
investigative journalist Patrick Tierney a National Book Award
nomination _ and bitter criticism from some scientists.

	   The book alleges that revered geneticist James V. Neel committed
acts of ethical misconduct, including starting a deadly epidemic
among South America's Yanomami Indians in <TIMEX2 val="1968" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1968</TIMEX2> by inoculating
villagers with a dangerous measles vaccine.

	   On <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, Tierney's appearance at the American Anthropological
Association's annual meeting drew hundreds of anthropologists. Many
clutched copies of ``Darkness in El Dorado.''

	   ``I understand the anger, and I do understand the grief people
have,'' Tierney told the crowd. ``They feel I have destroyed the
reputations of great scientists.''

	   Epidemiologists, a Venezuelan Indian and colleagues of Neel and
other men Tierney has criticized were on hand to challenge his
research.

	   ``Tierney says he spent <TIMEX2 val="P11Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">11 years</TIMEX2> researching his book, and it
took a matter of <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-17" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">days</TIMEX2> to prove some of his claims were not true,''
said William Irons, an anthropologist who represented famed Yanomami
ethnographer Napoleon Chagnon, whom Tierney also accuses of
misconduct.

	   Susan Lindee, who wrote a study of Neel's field research with
atomic bomb survivors, said, ``If you know anything about
epidemiology, you know these things are hard to track.''

	   Neel, a University of Michigan professor who died in <TIMEX2 val="2000-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">February</TIMEX2>,
was not ``warm and fuzzy,'' Lindee said. ``But he had integrity, and
he was a fair person.''

	   Yvonne Maldonado, who has worked as an epidemiologist with the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said no proof
exists that the vaccine Neel used could sicken anyone.

	   While Tierney isn't the first to accuse those anthropologists of
misconduct in their research and relationships with the Yanomami,
Tierney's work was given credibility when it was published by
respected publishing house W.W. Norton and landed a finalist slot in
the nonfiction category for a National Book Award, Irons said.

	   During its annual meeting, the association is devoting four
sessions to issues related to the book. The group also is proposing
that its committees investigate the claims, consider new ethical
guidelines for anthropologists and propose ways to preserve native
cultures in South America.

	   Tierney held firm to his claims throughout what became a
four-hour marathon debate <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>. He did admit his concern that the
controversy his book has generated among foreign governments may
hamper efforts to help the very indigenous cultures he sought to
preserve.

	   ``And I wonder, why do they want our saliva, why do they want our
skin when they don't want us?'' asked Noeli Pocaterra, a member of
the Wayuu tribe of Venezuela.

	   Lindee agreed.

	   ``The real issues are how have indigenous people been treated,
and how can we gather technological knowledge in a way that does not
exploit them,'' Lindee said.

	   The National Academy of Sciences, the University of Michigan and
the University of California, Santa Barbara all oppose the book. They
say it lacks scientific proof to back its claims _ something they say
Tierney could not adequately provide as a journalist despite his many
pages of references.

	   ``The citations are there,'' said Loring Brace, an anthropologist
with the University of Michigan who worked with Neel and Chagnon.
``But Tierney doesn't actually use the information in them.''
