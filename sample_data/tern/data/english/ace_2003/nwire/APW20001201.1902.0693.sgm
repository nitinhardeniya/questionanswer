Profile of Mexico's Vicente Fox

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Scion of a gentleman farmer, Vicente Fox made
good in the corporate world and then left it all to transform himself
into a politician the likes of which Mexico has never seen.

	   On Friday he became Mexico's new leader, the first in the
country's history to peacefully wrest the presidency from the party
in power.

	   He did so with his startling presence _ a 6-foot-5 rancher in
cowboy boots. With his charisma _ his ability to get people to
believe in him is legendary. With his persistence _ his tireless
campaign began early in his predecessor's term.

	   And with his proposals, laid out in simple language easily
understandable to the humblest of Mexicans: more education, more
loans, more jobs and less corruption.

	   Fox, 58, draws his style from his childhood in San Cristobal, a
village in north-central Guanajuato state that grew up around his
family's farming businesses.

	   Among his friends, he saw poverty of the kind most Mexican
politicians glimpse only from the window of a passing SUV. Among his
family, he saw the damage that bad economic policy has wrought on
small and medium businesses.

	   And from a college professor _ a Jesuit priest _ he understood
that people like him were doing nothing to change any of that.

	   Fox, who had risen from soft drink deliveryman to president of
Coca-Cola Mexico, had a crisis of conscience and decided in
mid-career that he would be different. An invitation to enter
politics from an opposition presidential candidate confirmed his
decision.

	   He immediately set his sights on the presidency, starting with a
congressional seat in 1988. He was cheated out of the governor's
office in 1991, but won easily the next time around in 1995. His
undeclared presidential campaign had already begun.

	   Touring much of Mexico and much of the world in what could be
Mexico's longest campaign ever, Fox drummed up investments and
marketed himself like the soft drink he once transformed into the
national leader.

	   On July 2, he defeated the presidential ruling-party candidate at
the polls, a victory that only months earlier had seemed a fantasy.

	   As he takes on the presidency, much of his homespun style will
come with him. Fox and his four adopted children _ he is divorced _
will move into guest quarters behind the presidential residence; his
daughter Ana Cristina says the residence ``is too much house for
us.''

	   He continues to wear his boots and giant ``FOX'' belt buckle, and
hints he might drop the coat and tie for most presidential
appearances.

	   And as he milked a cow and strolled through broccoli fields last
weekend, the image he presented was starkly different from any of
Mexico's previous presidents: a normal joe, a bit brighter than most,
who just happened to have won the presidency.
