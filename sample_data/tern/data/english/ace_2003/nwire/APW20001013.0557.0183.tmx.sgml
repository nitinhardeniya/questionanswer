Clinton's Dream of Peace Threatened

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ For <TIMEX2 val="P8Y" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">nearly eight years</TIMEX2> President Clinton has
worked doggedly on one, consistent foreign policy goal: becoming the
president who brought a widespread and enduring peace to the Middle
East.

	   <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-13T06:21:58" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> after <TIMEX2 val="P15D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-12" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">15 days of spiraling, hate-filled and deadly violence
between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors</TIMEX2>, those hopes appear
smashed, leaving the president and his team scrambling to restore
calm.

	   ``<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This</TIMEX2> obviously was <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="2000-10-13, but not given VAL because it's a predicate nominal">a bad day</TIMEX2>,'' a senior administration
official said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> after Israeli helicopters fired missiles at
Palestinian targets in the West Bank and Gaza in retaliation for the
deaths of three Israeli soldiers. ``To think we that we can go from
where we are right back into peace making isn't realistic. The wounds
that exist on both sides are quite deep.''

	   ``I think there's growing concern that you have a situation that,
if it continues this way, could, obviously spiral out of control,''
said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.

	   The president canceled <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the first day of a <TIMEX2 val="P4D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-13" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">four-day</TIMEX2>
country-spanning trip</TIMEX2> to stay at the White House and deal with the
crisis. He scrapped speaking and fund-raising appearances scheduled
for <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> in St. Louis, Kansas City, Mo., and Little Rock, Ark.
White House officials said decisions would be made later on the
remainder of the trip and its scheduled stops in Denver, Seattle,
Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles.

	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">The day of crisis</TIMEX2> began when Palestinians stormed a jail in
Ramallah and a mob beat three detained Israeli soldiers to death.
Israel immediately fired rockets at the residential compound of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

	   For the United States the crisis was compounded with an apparent
terrorist attack on a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole.

	   ``If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a
despicable and cowardly act,'' the president said, standing before
cameras in the Rose Garden. ``We will find out who was responsible
and hold them accountable.''

	   Clinton had hoped to begin and end <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2> on a high note.

	   He had spent <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the night</TIMEX2> at his home at Chappaqua, N.Y., where he
celebrated <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="unclear if this was the day of anniversary or just when they were celebrating it">his 25th wedding anniversary</TIMEX2> with his wife, Hillary. He
had planned <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day of golf</TIMEX2> after highlighting two foreign policy high
notes: the rolling back of sanctions in Yugoslavia where democracy
has been given new life and the intriguing prospect of a historic
trip to North Korea.

	   At <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">day's end</TIMEX2> Clinton and his team were trying to bridge a new
gulf of enmity and grievance between Israelis and Palestinians and
restore shattered communications and trust between the two sides.

	   Working with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and national
security adviser Sandy Berger, Clinton talked repeatedly with Arafat,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Jordan's King Abdullah, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

	   ``All the leaders share the president's concern that we have to
ramp down the violence'' before it escalates further, said National
Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley.

	   For <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-13T06:21:58" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the moment</TIMEX2>, the senior official acknowledged, ``the
psychology of anger'' is the controlling force, a force he said must
be subdued before more concrete steps at peace building can be
attempted.

	   This fact is all the more frustrating, he said, because as
recently as <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">12 days ago</TIMEX2> ``all of us felt that the possibility of
reaching agreement was quite real.''

	   Clinton has made Mideast peacemaking a foreign policy priority,
only to meet repeated disappointments with the collapse of the Camp
David summit, diplomatic failures and a resumption of violence.

	   Clinton said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ``is one of the
greatest tragedies and most difficult problems of our time. But it
can be solved.''
