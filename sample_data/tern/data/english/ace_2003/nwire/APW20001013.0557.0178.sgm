UFO Watchtower Provides a Platform

	   HOOPER, Colo. (AP) _ Green, glow-in-the-dark cutouts of bug-eyed
extraterrestrials line a dusty road off a two-lane highway in
southern Colorado.

	   Travelers stop in a makeshift parking lot on Judy Messoline's
ranch, get out and wander into a small, domed building with shelves
stocked with ``alien dust,'' posters, shiny extraterrestrial dolls
and pyramid candles.

	   Outside, steps lead to a 10-foot-high UFO-watching platform. For
$2, people can scan the skies for bright, darting lights and strange,
hovering crafts, the likes of which have been reported for decades by
residents and visitors in the San Luis Valley.

	   ``I didn't realize I could work 11 hours a day, seven days a week
and giggle the whole time,'' said Messoline, who, with her partner,
Stan Becker, opened the UFO watchtower on Memorial Day weekend.

	   The idea might sound like a joke, but tales of supernatural
phenomena abound in this naturally spectacular 50-mile-wide,
125-mile-long valley, which is 7,600 feet in altitude and ringed by
the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountains.

	   The UFO Computer Network Internet site ranks Saguache County,
home of the watchtower, as No. 1 nationwide in reports of
otherworldly sightings per capita _ 131 this year in the 4,619-person
area. Neighboring Alamosa County is No. 3.

	   Saguache County Undersheriff Mike Norris said his office doesn't
get frequent reports about mysterious lights or crafts, ``but people
talk and it gets out.''

	   The book ``The Mysterious Valley,'' by Christopher O'Brien,
examines reports through the years of cattle mutilations, mysterious
helicopters and oddly shaped aircraft hovering over the valley.

	   Messoline got the idea to build the watchtower after putting up
with ET enthusiasts camping on her property. She also needed to make
some money because cattle ranching, which drew her to the valley five
years ago, was foundering.

	   A big fan of ``The X-Files,'' a TV show about UFO-hunting FBI
agents, she admits she has seen strange lights in the sky. As for
believing in UFOs, she said, ``It would take one landing so I could
take a look.''

	   Restaurant owner Tim Edwards, who lives north of the valley, is a
believer. He made national news in 1995 when TV stations broadcast
his home videotape of what he believes was a UFO hovering near the
sun.

	   ``It was quite a spiritual experience. I basically kind of went
into an emotional trauma,'' Edwards said.

	   He called Messoline's watchtower ``a publicity stunt.''

	   ``You can drive up to about 12,000 feet here and see for a
hundred miles. You could just sit by your car and not pay,'' Edwards
said.

	   Dozens of people who have heard about the watchtower have visited
the ranch near Hooper, a town of 120 people about 220 miles southwest
of Denver.

	   For some, it has been a stop on a circuit that includes Roswell,
N.M., scene of what true believes say was a UFO crash in 1947 and the
site of the annual UFO Encounter, which draws tens of thousands of
people.

	   O'Brien, who lives in the valley, has made an avocation of
documenting the area's strange occurrences.

	   The reports stretch back centuries, with American Indians talking
about flying seed-pod-like objects, O'Brien said. Area newspapers in
the late 1800s and early 1900s ran stories about strange crafts and
lights.

	   People in the farming and ranching area tend to be set in their
ways and regard Messoline's watchtower with some cynical unease,
O'Brien said.

	   ``However, nobody is going out of their way to really slag her
about it,'' he said.

	   Instead, Messoline said she has taped hours of conversations with
residents who say they have had otherworldly experiences but don't
feel comfortable talking to most people about them.

	   O'Brien has heard the same thing from many people since writing
in a local newspaper about a wave of reported sightings in 1993.
``I've found myself acting like a paranormal counselor,'' he said.

	   Edwards said people who feel they have had a supernatural
encounter seek him out at his cafe, which he opened after his
experience. The restaurant, ``ET's Landing,'' has a 32-foot-by-8-foot
sign with a silver metallic disc bearing the words, ``Food that's out
of this world.''
