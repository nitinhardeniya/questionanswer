Russian Researcher Spy Trial Opens

	   KALUGA, Russia (AP) _ A Russian court on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> opened the
espionage trial of a Russian researcher whose family maintains his
only crime was reading between the lines of military publications.

	   After <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>'s hearing, the judges agreed to adjourn proceedings
until <TIMEX2 val="2001-01-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Jan. 9</TIMEX2> so defendant Igor Sutyagin, an analyst from the
respected Russian think tank, the Institute for USA and Canada
studies, could carefully review the charges.

	   The trial is the latest in a spate of espionage trials that human
rights activists say signals a witch hunt for independent thinkers
and a revival of the vast powers of Russia's secret services.

	   The Federal Security Service, which initiated the case, says it
is cracking down on spies who it says infiltrated Russia amid the
lawlessness that followed the Soviet collapse.

	   The closed-door trial took place in a run-down courthouse in
Kaluga, the regional center of Sutyagin's home province southwest of
Moscow.

	   It came <TIMEX2 val="2000-W52" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three weeks after American businessman Edmond Pope was
sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">20 years in prison</TIMEX2> for espionage</TIMEX2>. Pope was pardoned by
President Vladimir Putin on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 14</TIMEX2> and has returned to the United
States.

	   The security service, the main successor to the KGB, claims that
Sutyagin gave classified information on Russia's military to other
countries. The indictment says he was enlisted to spy for the United
States when he attended a scientific conference in Britain in <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early
1998</TIMEX2>, his lawyer Vladimir Vasiltsov said.

	   The USA and Canada Institute has no access to government secrets,
and Sutyagin maintains he only worked with open sources _ analyzing
and piecing together separate bits of information.

	   ``He would spread newspaper clippings around on the floor, on the
couch, on his desk, everywhere _ and crawl between them,'' said
Sutyagin's wife, Irina Manannikova. ``This would go on for <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-10" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="before the time of his arrest">days</TIMEX2> _ and
something would be born that way.''

	   The powers of Russia's special services had been trimmed under
ex-President Boris Yeltsin. But many analysts say the agencies have
started to reclaim their ground since Putin, a <TIMEX2 val="P16Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">16-year</TIMEX2> veteran of the
KGB, came to power.

	   In addition to the Pope case, two Russian environmental
researchers have <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-26T21:33:35" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> been tried for treason and espionage for
reporting on environmental pollution by the Russian Navy.

	   ``All these cases seemed to have been produced from the same
template,'' said Sutyagin's father, Vyacheslav. ``The election of
Putin may have served as a signal to start instilling fear.''

	   Files in Sutyagin's study at his home hold scores of newspaper
clippings, mostly from the official military <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">daily</TIMEX2> Krasnaya Zvezda,
with some passages underlined in red.

	   Sutyagin subscribed to several periodicals _ a fact that seemed
suspicious to investigators who searched his apartment at <TIMEX2 val="1999-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the time of
his arrest in <TIMEX2 val="1999-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October 1999</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>.

	   ``They actually asked: By what right do you subscribe to 15
periodicals at a time?'' said the researcher's father.

	   Sutyagin, 35, spent <TIMEX2 val="P14M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-10" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="it is 15 months from october 1999 to december 2000, so anchor date is not certain.">14 months in jail</TIMEX2> awaiting trial. But he
received the first details of the charges against him only in an
indictment filed on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 15</TIMEX2>, according to his lawyer.

	   The U.S. State Department would not comment on the case <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>.
