	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Divers slid video cameras attached to long rods
into a hole in the mangled forward section of the sunken submarine
Kursk on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, to assess the chances of recovering more bodies,
officials said.

	   The massive internal damage to the nuclear-powered vessel could
prevent divers from going further. The submarine was wracked by two
explosions, one of which had the force of a small earthquake and was
further magnified by the vessel's thick steel outer hull.

	   ``It's already clear that the third compartment suffered serious
damage as a result of the second powerful explosion,'' said Northern
Fleet spokesman Capt. Vladimir Navrotsky, adding that the damage may
be too extensive for the divers to enter the section.

	   The Kursk sank on <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug. 12</TIMEX2> after the two explosions, which tore
through the forward compartments and most likely killed most of the
118 crew members instantly.

	   But at least 23 sailors survived the initial explosion in the
submarine's stern, as indicated by a letter found in the sub. One of
the officers, Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, managed to write a farewell note
to his wife before dying, and officials divulged small snippets from
it <TIMEX2 val="2000-W43" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>.

	   Kolesnikov's body lay in state <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> in a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02T12:24:29" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Czarist
palace in his native city, St. Petersburg, and was to be buried later
in <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2>. His coffin, draped in the St. Andrew flag of the Russian
Navy, was surrounded by an honor guard in crisp dress uniform.

	   During the memorial ceremony, officials released another fragment
from his note. The excerpt was displayed in a black frame next to the
coffin.

	   ''<TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12T15:45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">15:45</TIMEX2>. It's dark to write here, and I'm trying to write
blindly. It seems we have no chance, no more than 10-20 percent. I
hope that at least someone will read this,'' Kolesnikov wrote,
according to state-controlled ORT television.

	   ``Here is a list of the crew who are in the ninth compartment and
will try to get out. Greetings to everyone, don't lose hope,'' the
note said.

	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12T15:45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">The time indicated</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12T15:45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">3:45 p.m.</TIMEX2>, was <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12T15:45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">more than four hours after the
two explosions sank the ship</TIMEX2>. Officials have not yet indicated
whether the list of names followed.

	   It took divers <TIMEX2 val="P2D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">two days</TIMEX2> to cut through the Kursk's double steel
hull into the forward compartment before inserting the video cameras,
said navy spokesman Navrotsky. <TIMEX2 val="2000-W44" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Earlier in the week</TIMEX2>, the divers
stopped working on the eighth and ninth compartments in the rear of
the submarine, where Kolesnikov's body and 11 others were retrieved.
The divers risked puncturing their pressure suits or air tubes if
they ventured further into the tangle of broken equipment, officials
said.

	   As the search moved to the forward compartments, Navrotsky
appeared downbeat about the chances of recovering more remains, many
of which were likely blown to bits by the explosions.

	   ``Experts will decide whether to enter the third compartment or
start work to cut a hole into the fourth compartment,'' he said.

	   Russian officials have focused on the theory that the blasts were
set off by a collision with another submarine shadowing Russian naval
exercises in the Barents Sea. But others have said the most likely
cause was a malfunction of a torpedo exploding in its tube.

	   Navrotsky said that three more bodies were identified as Lt.
Sergei Sadilenko, Lt. Rashid Aryapov and Warrant Officer Andrei
Borisov. Four others, including Kolesnikov's, had already been
identified.
