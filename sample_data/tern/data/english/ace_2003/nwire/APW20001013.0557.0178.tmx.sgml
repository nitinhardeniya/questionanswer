UFO Watchtower Provides a Platform

	   HOOPER, Colo. (AP) _ Green, glow-in-the-dark cutouts of bug-eyed
extraterrestrials line a dusty road off a two-lane highway in
southern Colorado.

	   Travelers stop in a makeshift parking lot on Judy Messoline's
ranch, get out and wander into a small, domed building with shelves
stocked with ``alien dust,'' posters, shiny extraterrestrial dolls
and pyramid candles.

	   Outside, steps lead to a 10-foot-high UFO-watching platform. For
$2, people can scan the skies for bright, darting lights and strange,
hovering crafts, the likes of which have been reported for <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">decades</TIMEX2> by
residents and visitors in the San Luis Valley.

	   ``I didn't realize I could work <TIMEX2 val="PT11H" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11 hours <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="P7D" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">seven days <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a week</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>
and giggle <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the whole time</TIMEX2>,'' said Messoline, who, with her partner,
Stan Becker, opened the UFO watchtower on Memorial Day weekend.

	   The idea might sound like a joke, but tales of supernatural
phenomena abound in this naturally spectacular 50-mile-wide,
125-mile-long valley, which is 7,600 feet in altitude and ringed by
the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountains.

	   The UFO Computer Network Internet site ranks Saguache County,
home of the watchtower, as No. 1 nationwide in reports of
otherworldly sightings per capita _ 131 <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2> in the 4,619-person
area. Neighboring Alamosa County is No. 3.

	   Saguache County Undersheriff Mike Norris said his office doesn't
get frequent reports about mysterious lights or crafts, ``but people
talk and it gets out.''

	   The book ``The Mysterious Valley,'' by Christopher O'Brien,
examines reports through <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the years of cattle mutilations, mysterious
helicopters and oddly shaped aircraft hovering over the valley</TIMEX2>.

	   Messoline got the idea to build the watchtower after putting up
with ET enthusiasts camping on her property. She also needed to make
some money because cattle ranching, which drew her to the valley <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">five
years ago</TIMEX2>, was foundering.

	   A big fan of ``The X-Files,'' a TV show about UFO-hunting FBI
agents, she admits she has seen strange lights in the sky. As for
believing in UFOs, she said, ``It would take one landing so I could
take a look.''

	   Restaurant owner Tim Edwards, who lives north of the valley, is a
believer. He made national news in <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2> when TV stations broadcast
his home videotape of what he believes was a UFO hovering near the
sun.

	   ``It was quite a spiritual experience. I basically kind of went
into an emotional trauma,'' Edwards said.

	   He called Messoline's watchtower ``a publicity stunt.''

	   ``You can drive up to about 12,000 feet here and see for a
hundred miles. You could just sit by your car and not pay,'' Edwards
said.

	   Dozens of people who have heard about the watchtower have visited
the ranch near Hooper, a town of 120 people about 220 miles southwest
of Denver.

	   For some, it has been a stop on a circuit that includes Roswell,
N.M., scene of what true believes say was a UFO crash in <TIMEX2 val="1947" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1947</TIMEX2> and the
site of the annual UFO Encounter, which draws tens of thousands of
people.

	   O'Brien, who lives in the valley, has made an avocation of
documenting the area's strange occurrences.

	   The reports stretch back <TIMEX2 val="PXCE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="20" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">centuries</TIMEX2>, with American Indians talking
about flying seed-pod-like objects, O'Brien said. Area newspapers in
<TIMEX2 val="18" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the late 1800s</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="19" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early 1900s</TIMEX2> ran stories about strange crafts and
lights.

	   People in the farming and ranching area tend to be set in their
ways and regard Messoline's watchtower with some cynical unease,
O'Brien said.

	   ``However, nobody is going out of their way to really slag her
about it,'' he said.

	   Instead, Messoline said she has taped <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">hours of conversations with
residents who say they have had otherworldly experiences but don't
feel comfortable talking to most people about them</TIMEX2>.

	   O'Brien has heard the same thing from many people since writing
in a local newspaper about a wave of reported sightings in <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1993</TIMEX2>.
``I've found myself acting like a paranormal counselor,'' he said.

	   Edwards said people who feel they have had a supernatural
encounter seek him out at his cafe, which he opened after his
experience. The restaurant, ``ET's Landing,'' has a 32-foot-by-8-foot
sign with a silver metallic disc bearing the words, ``Food that's out
of this world.''
