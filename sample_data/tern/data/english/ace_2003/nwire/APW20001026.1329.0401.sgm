Some Seamen Lived After Kursk Blast

	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ Nearly two dozen sailors survived the
powerful explosions that ripped through the nuclear submarine Kursk,
a note found in one seaman's pocket showed Thursday.

	   But it was not clear how long the 23 seamen stayed alive after
the blasts tore apart the submarine and sank it in the Barents Sea,
killing all 118 men aboard. And it provided no clues to the cause of
the August catastrophe.

	   The note turned up in the pocket of a seaman identified as Lt.
Dmitry Kolesnikov, commander of the Kursk's turbine section, Russian
Navy chief Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov said. His was among the first four
bodies retrieved Wednesday.

	   ``All the crew from the sixth, seventh and eighth compartments
went over to the ninth. There are 23 people here. We made this
decision as a result of the accident. None of us can get to the
surface,'' Kuroyedov quoted the note as saying, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.

	   The note was written between 1:34 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. local time
Aug. 12, the day of the disaster, said Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak,
chief of staff of the Northern Fleet. Foreign and Russian ships in
the area registered two powerful explosions around 11:30 a.m.

	   The note ``also said that two or three people might try to escape
the submarine through the emergency escape hatch located in the ninth
compartment,'' Motsak said.

	   Water that gradually flooded the ninth compartment could have
thwarted that escape attempt, he said. After the Kursk sank, Russian
submersibles were unable to latch onto the hatch, but Norwegian
divers who followed managed to open it a week after the tragedy and
determined that there were no survivors.

	   The question remained whether they might have been saved if
Russia hadn't waited for days before accepting foreign aid. But
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov quickly denied Thursday that
there was any possibility they could be rescued.

	   The crewmen had some chance of getting out on their own through
the escape hatch but apparently didn't do that because of injuries,
Igor Spassky, head of the Rubin design bureau that developed the
Kursk, said Thursday.

	   Kolesnikov's note went on to mention the figures 13 and five,
without explanation, and then added: ``I am writing blindly,''
Kuroyedov told families of the crew gathered in the Arctic port of
Murmansk. The rest of the note was private, Motsak said.

	   Many Russian officials had said some crew members could have
remained alive after the explosions, as indicated by reports of
tapping sounds detected from the submarine in the first days.

	   But others discounted the reports as unsubstantiated and said the
sounds could have been caused by collapsing equipment or the
submarine settling into the seabed.

	   The survivors of the initial explosions, which were minutes
apart, probably died of drowning, hypothermia or high pressure.
Kolesnikov, a 27-year-old son of a submariner from St. Petersburg,
was the only seaman to have been identified so far, admirals said.

	   Russian and Norwegian divers recovered the first bodies Wednesday
after five days of painstaking work to cut holes in the top of the
submarine.

	   After the note was discovered, divers concentrated on the ninth
compartment but were hampered by rough waters. Divers may cut a hole
in that compartment to facilitate the search, Motsak said.

	   Officials hope to fly the recovered bodies Saturday to
Severomorsk, the main base of the Northern Fleet, for a memorial
ceremony if weather permits, he said.

	   Up to two-thirds of the crew were likely blown to bits by
powerful explosions in the weapons room in the submarine's bow,
officials said. The Kursk's nuclear reactors were automatically shut
down, and there has been no radiation leak. The reactors were
``behaving ideally,'' Spassky said Thursday.

	   Kuroyedov had warned that he might cancel the recovery effort if
experts ruled that divers' lives were in danger.

	   But President Vladimir Putin promised to recover the bodies at an
emotional meeting with the crew's relatives shortly after the
disaster, and the government seemed bent on conducting the costly
effort despite the shortage of funds for the military.

	   Some Russian media have pointed out that by stubbornly conducting
the risky effort, the government sought to redeem itself for the
confused response to the sinking of the Kursk, when it resisted
foreign help for days while botching its own rescue efforts.

	   The cause of the disaster remains unknown, with authorities
suggesting a collision with a Western submarine or World War II-era
mine or to an internal malfunction.
