Arab Leaders May Cut Israel Ties
</HEADLINE>

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Arab summit called to confront a
frightening and deadly upsurge in Israeli-Palestinian violence ended
Sunday with a declaration that Arab countries may consider cutting
ties with Israel, but did not call on them to do so.

	   ``Arab leaders assert in the light of the collapse of the peace
process their commitment to standing up to Israeli attempts to
infiltrate the Arab world under any name and to the halting of
establishing any relations with Israel,'' said the final declaration,
read by Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid.

	   The declaration, read live on national television, went on to say
the Arabs would hold Israel responsible for the cancellation of
relations.

	   The carefully worded statement addressed what emerged as the most
contentious issue before the leaders meeting in Cairo: Whether ties
several have with the Jewish state should be reconsidered.

	   	Libya had walked out Saturday, the first day of the two-day
summit, saying it was frustrated that the leaders gathered would not
clearly call for an end to ties with Israel.

	   Only Egypt and Jordan have diplomatic relations with Israel.
Oman, which along with Qatar had lower level ties, suspended
relations on Oct. 12, closing Israel's trade mission in Muscat, the
capital, and withdrawing its trade envoy from Tel Aviv.

	   Libya had said cutting such ties was the least Arabs could do in
response to more than three weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence
that have left 117 dead and more than 2,000 wounded _ the vast
majority Palestinian.
