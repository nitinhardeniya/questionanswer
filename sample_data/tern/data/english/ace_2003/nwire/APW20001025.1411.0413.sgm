China Marks Korean War Anniversary

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China marked the 50th anniversary Wednesday of its
entrance into the Korean War with patriotic tributes to those who
died and praise for ``long overdue'' peace overtures between the
conflict's former enemies.

	   Members of the ruling Communist Party's inner circle took part in
somber ceremonies in Beijing and the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang _ evidence of the ties forged fighting South Korean and
U.S.-led forces in the 1950-53 conflict. But the ceremonies carried
traces of changes afoot in the region.

	   Defense Minister Chi Haotian, himself a Korean War veteran, stood
with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in May 1st Stadium _ where Kim
entertained U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright two days
earlier.

	   This time, instead of costumed, dancing children, the stadium was
a sea of green-uniformed soldiers, footage on Chinese state
television showed.

	   In Beijing's Great Hall of the People, President Jiang Zemin
urged Chinese seeking to build the country into a new power to draw
inspiration from the sacrifices made by China's ``volunteer'' army in
Korea.

	   ``To the very end, the volunteer officers and men placed the
motherland's and the people's interests above everything else,''
Jiang said addressing the communist elite, among them aged veterans
with strings of medals hanging from Mao suits. ``That spirit will
always be the precious riches of the Chinese people.''

	   Jiang mentioned the valiant fight against ``American aggression''
during the Korean War. But Beijing has in recent years used its
influence to push North Korea toward reconciliation with former foes
South Korea and the United States.

	   China, the only major power to have good relations with both
Koreas, welcomed the June summit between the leaders of the two
Koreas, Albright's visit to North Korea and announcements last week
that Britain, Germany, Spain and Belgium will normalize relations
with North Korea.

	   ``The world is witnessing a long overdue thaw of relations,'' the
China Daily said.

	   ``All such positive developments are well received in China
because peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula and permanent
peace there are exactly what our heroes and heroines fought for half
a century ago.''

	   China Daily and articles and editorials in state-run newspapers
said that war's economic cost and loss of 140,000 Chinese lives were
worthwhile.

	   The Korean War ``tells us that for a country to stand up among
the world's people, to not be humiliated and to receive respect it
must develop production and increase its overall strength,'' the
Communist Party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, said in a
front-page editorial.

	   Wednesday marked the day 50 years ago when China, mustering its
forces in North Korea in secret for weeks, opened skirmishes against
U.S., South Korean and other allied forces.

	   The surprise Chinese campaign pushed the allies back, laying the
ground for a protracted war that ended three years later with no
peace treaty.
