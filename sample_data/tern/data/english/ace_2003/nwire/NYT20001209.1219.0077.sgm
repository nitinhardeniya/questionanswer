	   Consumers across the country will face double-digit increases in
their health care costs starting in January, reflecting the biggest
surge in medical inflation since the early 1990s. The increases
will show up in larger deductions from paychecks and higher
deductibles and payments for care, especially prescription drugs.
	   Employers learned earlier this year that their health care
premiums would be increasing between 10 percent and 30 percent in
2001. Most companies across the country are absorbing the majority
of the hefty increases, hoping to retain important employees in a
tight labor market, but they are sharing the burden with workers.
And at some companies, employees are paying a growing share of the
costs.
	   As their health care expenses rise, low-income workers and the
self-employed may decide to drop coverage altogether. Although the
number of Americans without insurance dipped to 42.6 million last
year from 44.3 million in 1998 as many temporary workers moved up
to jobs with benefits, health policy experts say rising costs for
2001 may lead to an increase in the number of people without
insurance.
	   ``If the double-digit increases continue and the economy turns
down, that could eventually drive the uninsured to 50 million or
higher,'' said Jack Meyer, president of the nonprofit Economic and
Social Policy Research Institute in Washington.
	   ``My concern is that when costs go too high, there will be a
certain number of companies and employees who will say they can't
afford it,'' said Marshall Abrahams, president of Desks Inc., a
Denver office supply firm with 50 employees.
	   Employers facing double-digit premium increases are ``starting
to get panicky,'' said Janet Trautwein, policy director of the
National Association of Health Underwriters, an insurance agents
group. ``Rates are going up dramatically in some parts of the
country. Some employers have reduced their contributions and some
have changed the benefits'' to make them less costly, she said.
	   Large employers are raising payroll deductions by 20 percent, on
average, while adding 15 percent to what workers pay in deductibles
and copayments, said Kenneth L. Sperling, a health care expert at
Hewitt Associates, the benefits consulting firm.
	   Overall, employees of large companies will pay 18 percent more,
or $1,401 on average, in 2001, according to a Hewitt survey of 350
employers with 6 million workers and dependents. The employers'
health care costs will rise 9.8 percent to $4,026 per employee.
Combined costs for these companies and their workers will rise 17
percent, Hewitt said.

	   Costs are increasing for government employees as well. In the
federal employees' health plan, the nation's largest, monthly
payroll deductions will rise 14 percent to $74.23 in January for
most single employees, and increase 21 percent to $175.30 for
families, said Bill Pierce, a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, which covers about half of the eight million federal
workers and retirees. The annual deductible and employee payments
for hospital and outpatient care will also rise.
	   The trustees of the 1.2 million-member California Public
Employees' Retirement System, the nation's second-largest health
plan, will meet this week to deal with cost increases as high as 24
percent for 230,000 members of the system's financially troubled
networks of ``preferred'' doctors and hospitals. The system's staff
is suggesting cuts in coverage to keep down the increase in
premiums.
	   The staff proposals include doubling the annual deductible
employees pay, to $1,000 a family, and adding a $50 payment for
emergency room visits.
	   But for 850,000 of the California public employees, who are in
HMOs, several unions rejected cuts in benefits last summer. Their
premiums were then raised 9.2 percent for 2001.
	   Employers have been paying most of the increase in health care
costs over the last two years in order to retain workers in a tight
labor market. But if the economy slows, that could change.
	   ``The American public is in for a shock when the recession
comes,'' said Jon R. Gabel, vice president of the Health Research
and Educational Trust, an independent research affiliate of the
American Hospital Association. ``They have no idea how much health
care costs have increased over the last five or six years.''
	   Big companies that offer choices of health plans have long
arranged reduced premiums for low-cost plans. If workers choose a
more expensive plan, they often have to pay the difference in
charges, said Dave Rahill, a health care consultant in New York
with William M. Mercer, benefits consultants.
	   With health insurance costs rising, small companies are more
likely to follow suit and offer their employees more choices. Many
are joining health care purchasing alliances that offer an array of
choices, so their workers can also choose between joining a
low-cost plan or spending more if they want better protection.
	   Gary Ahlquist, a senior vice president at Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton,
a management consulting firm, predicted that as costs increase,
more employees will choose high-deductible insurance, with lower
premiums. That insurance may appeal to healthy people who are
willing to risk paying $1,000 or even $2,500 if they need care, he
said.
	   That would mark a change from past years. High deductibles
``have not been particularly successful'' in finding customers,
said Greg Scandlen, a senior health policy fellow in Washington at
the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research
center.
	   That may be because ``rank-and-file employees don't have the
resources to draw on, if they have to come up with $1,000
quickly,'' said Richard Ostuw, a health care expert with the Watson
Wyatt consulting firm.
	   ``When we raised prices, people left,'' said Mark Weinberg,
group president of individual and small employer business at
Wellpoint Health Networks, based in California. ``A certain
percentage went uninsured'' rather than pay higher premiums.
	   Wellpoint's California Blue Cross unit, which covers 850,000
individuals in the state, is also trying to give consumers more
options, lowering premiums to appeal to individuals without
insurance. At the same time, it is asking members who need care to
pay more. Under some policies, patients would pay 25 percent of the
charges for anything other than visits to the doctor, generic drugs
and preventive care, as well as a separate deductible for
brand-name drugs.
	   ``Seventy percent of any population spends $150 or less on
health care in a year,'' Weinberg said.
	   ``This is a watershed time for us,'' he added. ``Either we, as
an industry, recognize these cost trends and make the right
decisions,'' or the customers will drift away, going without
insurance or trying Internet-based alternatives to the managed care
companies.
	   But some employees have few choices. Until last year, Harlequin
Books, a publishing company, paid the entire cost of health
coverage for its 40 employees in New York as well as the 20 members
of its national sales force. The company gradually introduced
cost-sharing, requiring employees to cover 5 percent of health care
costs this year and 8 percent in 2001, when Harlequin's premiums
will rise 14 percent.
	   ``It's a problem for the employees,'' said Linda Kleinman,
manager of human resources and administration. ``They don't earn
princely sums. Publishing salaries are not like those in dot-com
companies.''
