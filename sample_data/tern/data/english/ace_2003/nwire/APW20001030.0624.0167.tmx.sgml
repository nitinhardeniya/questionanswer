Japan, N.Korea Talk on Relations

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Japan and North Korea on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> opened their third
round of talks <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2> on normalizing relations, as Tokyo tries not
to fall behind U.S. and South Korean efforts to improve ties with the
isolated communist nation.

	   Japanese chief negotiator Kojiro Takano welcomed his North Korean
counterpart, Jong Thae Hwa, at Japan's embassy on neutral territory
in Beijing for <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the first of <TIMEX2 val="P2D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-30" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">two days of talks aimed at laying the
groundwork for a <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-30" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2> agreement</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>.

	   Japan, which ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from <TIMEX2 val="1910" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1910</TIMEX2> to
the end of World War II in <TIMEX2 val="1945" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1945</TIMEX2>, has never had normal diplomatic ties
with North Korea, and intensely emotional issues still divide the
two.

	   The two previous rounds of talks have sputtered over North
Korea's insistence on compensation for Japan's often brutal
occupation and Tokyo's demands for information on Japanese citizens
allegedly abducted to North Korea to train spies.

	   Still, there's a sense of urgency in Tokyo, with the talks coming
on the heels of historic visits to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and South Korea's President Kim Dae-jung.
Germany, Britain and Spain have also made moves to normalize ties
with the North.

	   Some in Japan fear North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's recent
success in reaching out to other nations may even encourage him to
take a harder line with Tokyo.

	   North Korea broke off earlier talks on ties <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">eight years ago</TIMEX2> after
angrily rejecting Tokyo's demands to track down 10 Japanese citizens
allegedly abducted by Northern agents.

	   Although talks finally resumed in <TIMEX2 val="2000-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April</TIMEX2>, Tokyo and Pyongyang
still don't see eye to eye over the abduction issue. North Korea has
denied abducting anyone.

	   A public outcry was raised in Japan over press reports Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori may have backed a face-saving compromise raised
<TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three years ago</TIMEX2>. The deal would have allowed any Japanese in the
North to return via a third country without Pyongyang having to admit
wrongdoing.

	   A compromise may also be in the offing over Japanese colonization
of the Korean Peninsula.

	   The North Korean delegation is expected to press Japan for an
official apology and compensation for the occupation. Although Japan
has rejected the demands, it has expressed willingness to extend
economic aid, as it did upon normalizing relations with South Korea
in <TIMEX2 val="1965" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1965</TIMEX2>.

	   Since the last round of talks in <TIMEX2 val="2000-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2>, Japan has said it will
send half a million tons of rice over <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next two years</TIMEX2> to help ease
acute food shortages in the North. Japan's media have speculated that
offers of hefty aid packages may tempt Pyongyang into overcoming any
reluctance about signing a normalization agreement.

	   Japanese negotiators are also likely to address North Korea's
missile program, which sent a three-stage missile sailing over
northern Japan <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two years ago</TIMEX2>.
