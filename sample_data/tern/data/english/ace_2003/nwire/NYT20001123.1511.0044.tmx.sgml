	   More than 100 nations will be watching the Clinton
administration over <TIMEX2 val="P2W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W47" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next two weeks</TIMEX2> for a signal of whether the
United States will sign the treaty establishing the International
Criminal Court. The court would be the first such permanent body
set up to try individuals accused of war crimes, genocide and
crimes against humanity.
	   On <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, a <TIMEX2 val="P2W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W48" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="I want to mark it as two weeks starting Monday, but I will stick to the 'week' granularity">two-week</TIMEX2> preparatory commission meeting begins at
the United Nations. The United States is expected to announce its
final negotiating position for joining the court during that
session.
	   Until <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 31</TIMEX2>, a nation can indicate its support for the court
by signing the treaty, even if ratification is not immediately
likely. So far, 115 nations _ including all of Europe and the NATO
governments _ have signed and 22 countries have ratified the
treaty. After <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 31</TIMEX2>, a country will have to ratify before it can
join.
	   Clinton administration officials have said they support an
international court. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
instrumental in establishing ad-hoc tribunals for the Balkans and
Rwanda, which are seen as precursors of a permanent body.
	   But objections from the Pentagon have forced the administration
to demand a guarantee that no U.S. officer or civilian official on
duty abroad will fall under its jurisdiction _ even if the United
States is not a party to the court.
	   In the Senate, Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is
chairman of the foreign relations committee, has vowed that the
court would be ``dead on arrival'' if the administration sends the
treaty for ratification. Diplomats at the United Nations assume
that this view would be strengthened by a Republican administration
in Washington, and look to the departing Clinton administration as
a last chance.
	   Richard Dicker, a counsel at the monitoring organization Human
Rights Watch and an expert on the development of the new court,
said that in <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="MID" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">mid-October</TIMEX2> the United States in effect hardened its
position against prosecution and offered the same opportunity to
other nonsigners of the treaty if they pledged to try their own
citizens charged with infractions as the United States <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T15:26:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> does in
martial and civilian courts. This proposal violates the <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2> treaty
establishing the court, he said, and moreover is unnecessary.

	   ``The court's statute, the rules of procedure and evidence, and
the elements of crimes more than adequately address the risk of an
unjustified prosecution of a United States national,'' he said.
``An outright exemption would codify a two-tier system of justice:
one for the United States and another for the rest of the world.''
	   Arthur Robinson, president of Trinidad and Tobago, who as a
diplomat in <TIMEX2 val="1989" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1989</TIMEX2> first introduced the General Assembly motion that
ultimately created the court, said in New York on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> that its
establishment was ``a most significant achievement in the history
of mankind.''
	   ``This court recognizes that persons can be held individually
responsible for violations of international law,'' he said. ``And
the statute does not differentiate between persons in authority and
anyone else.'' He called this a ``dramatic step'' in the history of
international law.
	   Robinson recalled that it was the United States that had
established the principle of trials for the worst crimes against
humanity and crimes of war by insisting on the Nazi trial at
Nuremberg, when Stalin and Churchill were satisfied to have
offenders shot without a hearing. ``The U.S. wanted trials so that
the world could see the gravity of the offenses,'' he said.
``Nuremberg established individual guilt.''
	   ``<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T15:26:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>,'' Robinson said, ``there is a tremendous acceptance
internationally for this kind of court.''
