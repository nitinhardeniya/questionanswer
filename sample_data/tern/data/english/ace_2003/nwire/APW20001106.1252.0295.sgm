	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Four men arrested over the past two days are
being questioned about the fatal bombing of the USS Cole last month,
sources close to the investigation said Monday.

	   The newest suspects were tracked down through phone records
showing that the suspected bombers had been in contact with them, the
sources said on condition of anonymity.

	   All four live in the southern port city of Aden, where the two
suspected suicide bombers blew up a small boat filled with explosives
alongside the Cole on Oct. 12 as it prepared to refuel. Seventeen
Americans were killed.

	   Investigations have also revealed that officials in Lahej, a
stronghold of the militant Islamic Jihad, provided the suspected
bombers with government cars for use within Aden and between Aden and
Lahej, 22 miles to the north.

	   The sources said the suspected bombers knew the officials from
their time together fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

	   The officials are believed to be affiliated with the Islamic
Jihad, a group formed by veterans of the Afghan war, and had met
several times with the suspected bombers since March, when
preparations for the bombing are believed to have started.

	   According to the sources, the two men took their boat for a test
ride in the harbor where the Cole was to dock, one month before the
bombing. One of the fishermen who helped them take the boat down into
the water is believed to have been an accomplice, the sources said.

	   The United States is pressing Yemeni authorities leading the
probe to allow U.S. agents a greater role in the investigation.

	   A Yemeni official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Monday that authorities have turned down an American request to relay
their questions to the detainees. He said that expanding the American
role in the investigation is being discussed, but that his country's
stand remains that the Americans cannot interrogate any Yemeni
citizens.

	   There has been no claim of responsibility considered credible in
the strike on the Cole. American officials have said Osama bin Laden
_ America's No. 1 terror suspect who has pledged to drive the U.S.
military out of the Middle East _ is a focus of the bombing
investigation. The Saudi millionaire, who is living in Afghanistan,
is accused of masterminding the 1998 bombings on U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
