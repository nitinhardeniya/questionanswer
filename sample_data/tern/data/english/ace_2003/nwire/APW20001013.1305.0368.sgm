Russia Sub Collision Theory Nixed

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ No fragments of a foreign submarine have been found
near Russia's sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, and officials no longer
consider a collision with another vessel the most likely cause of the
tragedy, Russia's deputy prime minister said Friday.

	   Investigators still haven't determined what caused an explosion
that sent the Kursk crashing to the bottom of the Barents Sea during
naval exercises Aug. 12. All 118 sailors aboard died.

	   For months, Russian officials insisted that the most likely cause
was a collision with a foreign submarine or ship. Other versions they
considered were a collision with a World War II mine or a malfunction
in the Kursk's torpedo department.

	   None of the possibilities have been ruled out, but ``none of them
is dominant'' any longer, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov was
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Klebanov heads the
government commission investigating the tragedy.

	   Submersibles inspected a 60-square-mile area of the Barents Sea
floor around the Kursk but found no pieces of a foreign submarine,
Klebanov said.

	   Russian rescuers tried for a week to get inside the Kursk, while
officials insisted that at least some of the crew was still alive.
But Klebanov said Friday that most of the sailors were killed in the
seconds following the explosion _ confirming earlier conclusions by
independent experts.

	   ``By the time the vessel hit the bottom, almost all of the crew
was already gone,'' he told reporters.

	   An operation to retrieve the crew's remains is to begin late next
week. But the submarine has been severely mangled, meaning that
divers will not be able to reach many of the bodies, and those they
do recover may be damaged by the explosion and subsequent corrosive
sea water, Russian officials have said.

	   Russian deep-water capsules have examined the Kursk and recorded
``catastrophic destruction,'' Klebanov said.

	   ``It's just heaps of metal piled up, which would of course
complicate the divers' work,'' he said.
