Weather Deteriorates at Kursk Site

	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ Russian and Norwegian divers have removed
a rubber coating between the inner and outer hulls of the sunken
nuclear submarine Kursk as deteriorating weather Sunday threatened to
curtail the operation to recover the bodies of the 118 sailors
inside.

	   A thick fog, rain and high winds have strongly limited visibility
at the site, and a cold front was forecast for late Sunday, raising
the possibility of gale force winds that could complicate the work of
divers, Russian navy spokesman Vadim Serga said.

	   The divers, working through the night, successfully removed the
industrial rubber coating between the inner and outer hulls, Capt.
Vladimir Navrotsky, the northern fleet's chief spokesman, said. The
rubber was designed to muffle sounds from inside the submarine to
make it harder to detect, and was apparently sturdier than the divers
expected.

	   Following the removal of the rubber, divers cut a four-inch hole
in the thicker inner hull leading to the submarine's stern
compartment number 8, Navrotsky said.

	   He said the divers were cutting and removing pipes and
obstructions in the six-foot space between the hulls that could tear
diving suits. He said work on enlarging the opening could begin by
late Monday.

	   Navrotsky said the weather was steadily getting worse, but that
the divers would continue working unless the winds reached light gale
force.

	   On Saturday, the divers carefully pried off two small sections of
the outer hull, the first step in the planned recovery operation in
which holes would be cut through both hulls to pull bodies or body
parts out into the ocean to bring to the surface.

	   The divers arrived at the site in the Barents Sea on Friday night
_ more than two months after the accident that destroyed the Kursk _
and began the round-the-clock recovery operation.

	   The operation is concentrated outside the submarine's rear two
compartments. The rear was less damaged than the front end, which
suffered an explosion and hit the sea floor first in the Aug. 12
accident. The ship lies 330 feet below the surface.

	   Serga said cutting into the thicker inner hull probably wouldn't
be completed until Tuesday.

	   All 118 seamen on board the Kursk died when the submarine
exploded and sank during naval exercises in the Barents Sea. Russian
officials have not determined the cause of the accident. They are
considering an internal malfunction, a collision with a Western
submarine or collision with a World War II-era mine.
