EU To Begin Building Defense Force

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union went into the defense
business Monday, pledging tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of
warplanes and ships to a new European rapid reaction force that is
still more a dream than reality.

	   The 15-nation EU is seeking to give itself military clout to back
up its economic and political power and to step out of the shadow of
the United States, which dominates Europe's principal defense
organization _ NATO.

	   Whether they are called European or NATO, however, defense and
foreign ministers who met here were talking about the same forces. No
new units were created, and, for the moment, no appreciable amount of
new money will be spent. Many of the troops designated for the EU are
also pledged to NATO.

	   The force was being assembled a year after the 15 EU leaders
decided in Helsinki, Finland, to create a corps of 60,000 troops
capable by 2003 of deploying within 60 days and remaining on the
ground for up to a year.

	   In practical terms, this means creating a pool of forces of
100,000-120,000 to give commanders a choice of capabilities for a
wide variety of missions. Taking into account a rotation of troops
every six months, that means a pool of 200,000-250,000 troops for a
yearlong mission.

	   ``We are now entering into a major commitment in the European
Union,'' said Defense Minister Alain Richard of France, which holds
the EU presidency.

	   Richard said about 100,000 troops, 400 combat aircraft and 100
ships were pledged to the EU on Monday. The next step is to transform
this paper army into a real, deployable force capable of fulfilling
the limited missions set out for it _ humanitarian, peacekeeping and
peacemaking duties.

	   Despite meeting its goal in terms of numbers, large gaps remained
in air and sea transport, precision-guided weapons, all-weather
flying capability, satellite intelligence, communications and command
and control systems.

	   The priority now, Javier Solana, the EU's chief of foreign and
security policy, said, is to close the gaps. He said the EU has much
of what it needs and is determined to come up with the rest before
the 2003 deadline.

	   ``I would hope we would have some limited initial capability next
year,'' said Geoff Hoon, Britain's defense minister.

	   Hoon said: ``What is being done is going to make NATO stronger,
not weaker.''

	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer agreed.

	   ``We need a strong European pillar (in NATO),'' he said. ``This
is part of the European integration process.'' He added there is no
longer a division between the civilian and military aspects of crisis
management.

	   EU forces will not be involved in territorial defense, which is
essentially NATO's job. The plan is for them to be used in
humanitarian, peacekeeping and peacemaking roles when NATO as a whole
_ or the United States _ declines a role.

	   ``The EU is determined that it should play a more complete role
in tackling crises,'' said Solana, calling Monday's pledging session
``a serious first step.''

	   The United States has cautiously backed the EU's military
efforts, after some initial hesitation, calculating that anything
improving European defense is good for NATO. Washington wants to make
sure that NATO is still the defense arm of first choice and that
European efforts don't lead to unnecessary duplication.

	   Still, some people both in the United States and Europe fear the
EU force is the first step down the road to disintegration of the
19-nation NATO.

	   Lord Robertson, the NATO secretary-general, was to dine with EU
ministers Monday evening to discuss the alliance's concerns.

	   ``There is no will in Europe to use its collective capabilities
against NATO,'' said Richard of France.
