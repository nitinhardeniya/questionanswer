Clinton Undecided on N. Korea Visit

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ President Clinton will not go to North Korea
after his upcoming trip to Vietnam but still may make an
unprecedented visit to the communist country before he leaves office
in January, a White House official said Saturday.

	   The United States and North Korea ended three days of talks
Friday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, without agreeing on a way to curb
North Korea's missile program _ the chief obstacle to a possible trip
by Clinton.

	   ``The president has not made a decision yet on whether he will
visit Pyongyang,'' the North Korean capital, said Daniel Cruise, a
spokesman for the National Security Council.

	   ``A decision has been made that it's not going to happen at the
end of the (Asian) trip, but the final decision on whether he'll go
there before the end of his term has not been made,'' Cruise said
Saturday.

	   ``More discussion needs to happen in Washington. We want a fuller
readout on the talks in Kuala Lumpur,'' Cruise said from Washington.
Clinton was on a political trip in New York.

	   After those talks, Robert Einhorn, assistant secretary of state
for nonproliferation, said that although progress was made,
``significant issues remain to be explored and resolved.'' No new
talks were scheduled.

	   The dialogue over missiles are a key part of efforts to defuse
the world's last major Cold War front and improve terms long-term
hopes for peace in Northeast Asia.

	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who recently made a
groundbreaking visit to Pyongyang, said her conversations with North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il yielded ``substantial progress'' on
security issues.

	   Kim has indicated a willingness to curb missile development and
missile exports in exchange for economic ties with the United States.
North Korea has been destitute for much of the period since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, its main benefactor.

	   White House officials had considered whether to add a brief
presidential stop in North Korea to Clinton's trip to Vietnam and
Brunei.

	   ``The decision not to go at the end of this trip'' was made just
recently, Cruise said.

	   Clinton plans to visit Vietnam at the end of a scheduled trip to
Brunei, where he is to attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum on Nov. 15-16.
