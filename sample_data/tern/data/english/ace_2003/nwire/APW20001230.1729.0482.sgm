Putin Still Facing Many Challenges

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Charging through his first year at Russia's helm,
Vladimir Putin rarely stepped on the brakes, ramming through measure
after measure to consolidate his grip on power. But as he enters
2001, the tasks still look enormous: a seemingly endless war in
Chechnya and a populace demoralized by years of crime, poverty and
corruption.

	   ``I hope that with time, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin will turn
from the problems he knows to the real problems plaguing society,''
said Vladimir Rimskiy, an analyst with the Information for Democracy
Foundation.

	   Boris Yeltsin shocked the nation and the world when he abruptly
stepped down Dec. 31, 1999, and named his prime minister acting
president. But Russians were pleased with the choice, and they
delivered Putin a resounding victory in the March 26 presidential
election.

	   Putin quickly moved to remake the relationship between Moscow and
the regions, pushed through tax reform and a long-stalled arms
control treaty, and toured the world to underline that Russia was
still a power to be reckoned with. He said his policies were oriented
toward a common goal: priming Russia for reform to reverse the
nation's decline.

	   The economy was buoyed by high world prices for oil, one of
Russia's major export earners, but it was widely expected to decline
in 2001 as oil prices fall. Putin warned this week that economic
growth, which reached some 7 percent in 2000, was already sagging,
and that unemployment seemed to be rising.

	   The popularity he won through raising pensions and salaries _
bringing real income up by 7 percent _ could fade fast if the economy
sinks. Putin told Russian reporters this week that he was torn
between the need to institute far-reaching reforms and to ease social
pressures.

	   ``I always keep in mind that despite all the positive tendencies,
a huge number of our citizens endure extreme hardship and live in
poverty,'' Putin told Russian journalists this week. ``I would not
say that this feeling helps to make pragmatic or even technocratic
decisions in the economic sphere ... . But this feeling helps me to
make more balanced decisions and it is by no means harmful for a
leader of such a country.''

	   Putin's other big, haunting problem is the Chechen war.

	   In spite of his vows to crush separatist rebels, the conflict has
ground into its 16th month. Putin has shown no sign that he would try
to negotiate an end to the war next year _ and rebels have
demonstrated time and again that they can inflict daily casualties on
federal forces.

	   The explosion and sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk
underlined the decay in the Russian armed forces and the pressing
need for long-delayed military reform. Putin said this week that
Russia's long-term goal must be a professional army to replace the
mandatory draft _ but he said that would take years.

	   Aging infrastructure and frequently flouted safety regulations
also took their toll in 2000. The fire that ravaged the Ostankino
television tower pointed up the disastrous neglect that put Russian
lives at risk every day. Yet Putin has not indicated that he'll
devote scarce resources to cleaning up the mess.

	   Russians' chief hope was that the new president would reverse the
nation's decades-long decline, which accelerated following the 1991
Soviet breakup.

	   They saw in Putin everything that his predecessor Boris Yeltsin
lacked: energy, sobriety, pragmatism and a knack for forging
consensus.

	   Putin, a 16-year veteran of the Soviet KGB, proved to be a
talented political operator. His team combined liberal economists and
old-style security operatives, and he pushed Russia to acknowledge
its contradictory heritage by adopting symbols including the czarist,
double-headed eagle and the Soviet anthem.

	   He deftly disarmed almost all opposition, either by coopting
dissenting politicians, cowing them or simply pushing them out. The
lower house of parliament, the State Duma, acceded to his every
request, from cutting the powers of regional governors to passing the
nation's first balanced budget. Most of the media fell in lockstep
behind him.

	   Putin's most ambitious project was administrative reform to
reassert the federal government's control over the country's 89
regions. The move was aimed at undoing one of Yeltsin's legacies:
giving the regions autonomy, which some leaders had used to build
their own political and economic empires.

	   He also worked to make good on his pledge to raise Russia's
standing in the world.

	   Less than a month after winning the presidential election, he
persuaded the two parliamentary chambers finally to ratify the 1993
START II nuclear arms reduction treaty, which Yeltsin and President
Clinton had signed in 1993 and the former, Communist-dominated
legislature had blocked.

	   But there was also a chill in U.S.-Russian relations. Putin
repeatedly objected to Washington's possible deployment of a new,
limited missile defense. More ominously, for the first time in 40
years, an American was convicted of espionage in Russia.

	   Edmond Pope, a former naval officer-turned-freelance defense
contractor, protested his innocence, and both his lawyer and the U.S.
government said prosecutors didn't prove his guilt. Still, Pope was
sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison. Putin pardoned him as a
humanitarian gesture.

	   In a series of whirlwind foreign visits, Putin made fast friends
with Western leaders, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
German Chancellor Helmut Schroeder. But he discomfited the United
States in particular with trips to such old Soviet allies as North
Korea and Cuba.

	   At home, such visits won him praise from the Communists and other
hard-liners. Liberals expressed misgivings.

	   ``He decided to become a link between them and the rest of
civilization, and that's not a bad thing,'' said Mikhail Fedotov, the
head of the Russian Journalists Union. ``But when you go into a
quarantine ward trying to cure someone else, it's important not to
get infected yourself. Don't turn Russia into North Korea.''

	   There were worrying signs that the government would crack down on
press freedoms. In January, federal authorities arrested Radio
Liberty reporter Andrei Babitsky in Chechnya and handed him over to
alleged Chechen rebels _ whom Babitsky claimed were tied with Russian
security services.

	   Human rights advocates claimed Putin had given the security
services and prosecutors new freedom to persecute opponents,
including environmentalists and business leaders Boris Berezovsky and
Vladimir Gusinsky. The two are among the so-called oligarchs who used
their connections with Yeltsin's inner circle to spin vast fortunes,
and both own large media interests in Russia.

	   Putin denied the agencies were working for political ends, but at
every turn he stressed the need to safeguard the nation's security.
And he vowed that his administration would not tolerate the
oligarchs' interference in government.

	   Putin spoke frequently about the need for economic reform, and he
surrounded himself with pro-market economists. But with the exception
of the tax reform _ which introduced a flat, 13 percent income tax as
of Jan. 1, 2001 _ the government did not manage to turn any reform
policy into reality.

	   ``This year has been the year of missed chances,'' said Boris
Nemtsov, a leader of the pro-reform Union of Right Forces.

	   He said Putin's priorities in 2001 should be revamping the
nation's natural gas, electricity, and railroad monopolies; carrying
out land reform; strengthening the corrupt and ineffectual court
system; and implementing radical cuts in the military.

	   Another area where Russians expect results is in the battle
against corruption. In spite of Putin's pledge to install a
``dictatorship of law,'' bribe-taking, favoritism and the diversion
of state funds still thrive.

	   Rimskiy, the political analyst, said continuing corruption proved
that Putin still had not established enough authority to tackle the
nation's most difficult problems.

	   ``I think that Vladimir Putin is, as a person, concerned to end
corruption. He thinks it's unacceptable to allow criminals to come to
come to power, to allow budget money to be squandered, that it's
absolutely unacceptable that people freeze in the winter when there
are enough energy resources,'' Rimskiy said.

	   ``But he's unable to solve these problems. His tragedy is that he
understands this, he feels that it's not working _ a management
system that could achieve big government tasks.''
