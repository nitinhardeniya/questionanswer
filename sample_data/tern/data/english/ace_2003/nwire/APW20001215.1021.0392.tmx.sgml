	   LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) _ U.S. businessman Edmond Pope, fresh
from being pardoned by Russia for a spying conviction he denies, was
in good spirits <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> after <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-14TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a restful first night in freedom at a
German hospital</TIMEX2>, a spokeswoman said.

	   Pope, 54, arrived at the U.S. military's Landstuhl Medical Center
within <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-14" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered him
released <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. He immediately underwent medical tests and
counseling, seeing a specialist for internal medicine and a
psychologist _ and then had a good night's sleep, hospital
spokeswoman Marie Shaw said.

	   ``He rested very well. He is in good spirits,'' she said. ``And
he's had a good breakfast.''

	   Pope had been sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">20 years in jail</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-W49" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>, the first
alleged U.S. spy convicted by Russia in <TIMEX2 val="P4DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">four decades</TIMEX2>, but Putin
pardoned him to help relations with the United States. Pope looked
tired when he arrived in Germany after <TIMEX2 val="P253D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-14" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">253 days in Moscow's
high-security Lefortovo prison</TIMEX2>.

	   The release came soon after George W. Bush accepted victory in
the U.S. presidential election, and some Russian experts speculated
the move was made in hopes of garnering the president-elect's favor.
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> was <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="predicate nominal, but definite so I gave it a VAL">the first day Putin could have released Pope under
Russian law</TIMEX2>. A presidential pardons commission had recommended the
move following Pope's conviction.

	   A Putin spokesman told The Associated Press that the Russian
leader pardoned Pope on humanitarian grounds and to preserve good
relations with Washington. President Clinton welcomed the release.

	   Pope, who has suffered in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-15T11:43:17" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the past</TIMEX2> from a rare form of bone
cancer and whose health deteriorated while in prison, was to undergo
a complete medical examination at Landstuhl, about 85 miles southwest
of Frankfurt. Doctors said he might spend <TIMEX2 val="PT24H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-14" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">24</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="PT36H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-14" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">36 hours in Germany</TIMEX2>
before returning to Oregon, where his parents live.

	   One of Pope's first wishes <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> was for a cup of black
coffee. Hospital officials said he appeared healthy and not
malnourished.

	   Pope has rejected Russian charges that he illegally obtained
plans for a top-secret Russian Navy torpedo, saying what he purchased
was not secret and that the technology had already been sold abroad.
Pope sent a letter to Putin asking for clemency on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the eve of his
conviction</TIMEX2>, said his wife, Cheri.

	   Cheri Pope had headed to the prison <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-14TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday morning</TIMEX2> only hoping
to visit her husband for the first time since the <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 6</TIMEX2> verdict. She
had been denied visits on several previous attempts, said Jennifer
Bennett, spokeswoman for Pope's Pennsylvania Congressman, Rep. John
Peterson. Instead, Pope was let go, and he and his wife soon were on
a plane to Germany.

	   Pope's company, TechSource Marine Industries, is based in State
College, Pa.
