Sailor Trapped in Kursk Buried

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ ``Mustn't despair'' _ these words
from Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov's note, scribbled in the dark inside the
sunken submarine Kursk, were displayed in a black frame <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> next
to his flag-draped coffin.

	   Funeral services for Kolesnikov, one of the 12 sailors whose
bodies have been recovered from the wreck by deep-sea divers, were
held in his hometown of St. Petersburg.

	   The recovery of the note helped revive public criticism over the
military's slow response to the <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug. 12</TIMEX2> disaster.

	   Written as he and other sailors huddled in an intact rear
compartment after explosions ripped the front of the submarine apart,
it showed that at least some sailors survived the initial catastrophe
_ despite official claims that everyone had died almost immediately.

	   His widow, Olga, sat with his father, a retired submarine sailor,
his mother and his brother Alexander, also a submarine officer, in
the hall at the Admiralty, the <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">czarist-era</TIMEX2> naval headquarters and a
city landmark for its soaring golden spire.

	   Russian Orthodox priests chanted funeral prayers, and black-clad
sailors fired a graveside salute. Mourners tossed earth onto the
coffin, slowly covering it and the naval officer's hat placed on top
of it.

	   The note read:

	   ''<TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12T15:45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">15:45</TIMEX2>. It's too dark to write, but I'll try by touch. It seems
there is no chance, 10-20 percent. We hope that at least someone will
read this.

	   ``Here are lists of the personnel of the compartments who are in
the ninth (compartment) and will try to get out.

	   ``Hi to everyone. Mustn't despair.''

	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12T15:45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">The time</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12T15:45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">3:45 p.m.</TIMEX2>, was <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12T15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">more than four hours after two
explosions sank the vessel</TIMEX2>. Officials have not yet indicated whether
a list of names followed, or released the full text. They have said
the note contained lines written to Kolesnikov's family which they
will not release.

	   Kolesnikov's mother, Irina, told The Associated Press her son's
death certificate gave the cause of death as carbon monoxide
poisoning. No explanation was given about the source of the gas.

	   Kolesnikov's funeral was attended by St. Petersburg's governor,
Vladimir Yakovlev, and Northern Fleet commander Vycheslav Popov, and
was covered by all three national television channels.

	   Servicemen's funerals, especially of the more than 2,500 killed
in the war with rebels in Chechnya, usually do not get national TV
coverage or VIP attendance, and families of the Chechnya war dead
have grumbled about the discrepancy.

	   Officials have heaped praise on the Kursk crew, perhaps mindful
of public criticism that the navy lacked rescue equipment to reach
the sunken sub and initially refused foreign help. Norwegian divers
opened the submarine <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">nine days after the sinking</TIMEX2> and were the first
to determine there were no survivors.

	   On <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, divers halted work cutting into the third section of
the submarine after video footage showed massive damage inside that
could risk their safety, Northern Fleet spokesman Igor Babenko said.
The divers risked puncturing their pressure suits or air tubes if
they ventured further.

	   The divers began work on carving a hole in the hull of the
adjacent fourth section in hopes of recovering more bodies, Babenko
said. The fourth section is farther away from the torpedo rooms in
the nose, where the explosions occurred.

	   ``Work was stopped because of the threat to the divers' lives and
safety,'' Babenko said. The video footage showed ``major damage in
the (third) compartment,'' including machinery that had been blasted
back from the second compartment in the explosion, he added.

	   Earlier in <TIMEX2 val="2000-W44" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the week</TIMEX2>, the divers stopped working on the eighth and
ninth compartments in the rear of the submarine, where Kolesnikov's
body and 11 others were retrieved.
