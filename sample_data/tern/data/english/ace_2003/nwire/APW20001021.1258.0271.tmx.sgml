Divers Begin Recovery of Kursk Sub

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A team of Russian and Norwegian divers on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>
entered the waters where the Kursk nuclear submarine sank, and sliced
two holes in the outer hull, officials said.

	   The divers arrived at the site <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, after <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-20" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">months of planning</TIMEX2>,
and immediately began preparations for recovering the bodies of the
118 sailors inside the submarine, Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo
said.

	   ``<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21T01+02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Around 1 a.m. in the morning Moscow time</TIMEX2>, divers started
submerging with the aim of inspecting and preparing the hull of the
submarine for cutting openings,'' Dygalo said.

	   By <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21TAF" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late afternoon Saturday</TIMEX2>, the divers had cut two holes in the
hull's outer layer above the submarine's rear two compartments, navy
spokesman Vadim Serga said. He said cutting into the thicker inner
hull would probably take place <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> and last <TIMEX2 val="PT15H" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="2000-10-24" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">15 hours</TIMEX2>.

	   The rear of the ship is less damaged than the front, which
suffered an explosion and hit the sea floor first in the <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug. 12</TIMEX2>
accident.

	   Capt. Vladimir Navrotsky, the northern fleet's chief spokesman,
told a briefing in the port city of Murmansk that the divers could be
ready to cut through the hull's inner layer by <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday night</TIMEX2>. He said
four Russian and two Norwegian divers were working in teams to carry
out the operation.

	   Birger Haraldseid, a spokesman for the Norwegian subsidiary of
Halliburton, the Dallas-based oil services company, said from Norway
that the dive was on schedule and there were no problems so far.

	   ``The divers have bled off the pressure of some high pressure
pipes to ensure they are neutralized,'' he said. ``This is an
important safety measure.''

	   The divers sailed <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> from the Norwegian port of Hammerfest on
the mother ship Regalia. They found calm seas in the Barents Sea area
where the Kursk exploded and sank on <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug. 12</TIMEX2>, and the weather in the
region <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> was good, Haraldseid said.

	   However, meteorologists have warned that the seas could grow
rough <TIMEX2 val="2000-W43" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next week</TIMEX2>, complicating the salvage effort.

	   Dygalo said, ``the practical preparatory stage pursues the aim of
creating all the necessary conditions for the penetration of the
compartments of the submarine Kursk.''

	   Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> that
it would take until <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> to conclude preparations for the actual
recovery. ``The operation will likely start <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> or <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>,''
Klebanov said.

	   Halliburton is working with Russia's Rubin military design bureau
to organize the recovery, in which divers would cut holes in the
submarine's double hull to pull bodies or body parts out into the
ocean to bring to the surface.

	   All 118 seamen on board the Kursk died when the submarine
exploded and sank during naval exercises in the Barents Sea. Russian
officials have not determined the cause of the accident. They are
considering an internal malfunction, a collision with a Western
submarine or collision with a <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">World War II-era</TIMEX2> mine.
