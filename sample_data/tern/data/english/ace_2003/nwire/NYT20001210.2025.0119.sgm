	   WASHINGTON _ Prominent congressional Democrats and some
Republicans said on Sunday that the U.S. Supreme Court should be
the last word in the divisive, monthlong standoff over the
contested presidency.
	   But Sen. Trent Lott, the highest-ranking Senate Republican, did
not discourage the Florida Legislature from acting on behalf of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, should the nation's highest court
unexpectedly find in favor of Vice President Al Gore in his quest
for recounts.
	   As House and Senate members spoke a day before the Supreme Court
was to hear arguments on whether to allow manual recounts to resume
in Florida, they began to look beyond the contested election to how
to govern. The lawmakers said they were keenly aware of the
difficulties of making government work with a split Congress and a
president who, no matter who prevails, would probably face
lingering questions about his legitimacy.
	   ``If this is concluded in the next 48 hours, the person who is
on the losing side of this should go and meet with the winner,''
said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., on ``Fox News Sunday.'' He
added: ``They should make an appearance together. There should be
an immediate call for national unity and for accepting the results
of this election, getting about the country's business.''
	   A day after Democrats criticized the U.S. Supreme Court for its
5-to-4 vote Saturday to stop the recount that had begun just hours
earlier in Florida, party leaders sought to moderate any anticourt
tones.
	   On Saturday, some angry Democrats had said the Supreme Court had
diminished its credibility. But on Sunday, Democratic leaders said
they would rally around any court decision, and they sought to
contrast themselves with Republicans who have used phrases like
``judicial aggression'' and ``unelected judges'' while objecting to
rulings in favor of Gore by the Florida Supreme Court.
	   ``We have a court system,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
the House minority leader. ``We have a rule of law in this country.
And I have said from the beginning we have got to stick with it.''
	   Asked whether Gore should concede if the court found in favor of
Bush's effort to stop the recount, Gephardt said on ABC's ``This
Week,'' ``I believe he will, and I think George Bush would do the
same thing if it were the other way around.''
	   Torricelli also said of the expected Supreme Court ruling: ``I
believe that probably is the last word, and it's the last chance to
have this issue not go to the United States Congress. I think it
would be very regrettable if the fight in Florida became a fight in
Washington.''
	   Under the Constitution, Congress can approve or reject the
members of the Electoral College. If Florida's electors were in
dispute, Congress might face a bruising fight.
	   But in his appearance on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Lott, the
Senate majority leader, declined to call for the Florida
Legislature to hold off on naming Bush electors should the U.S.
Supreme Court unexpectedly support Gore's drive for a recount.
	   ``I am sure that they would prefer not to have to step in,'' he
said of the Florida lawmakers, ``but they do have a role to play,
and I think they are prepared to do that.''
	   Asked whether he would support such a step, Lott, of
Mississippi, said, ``Well, I wouldn't oppose it.'' He added that it
was not his first choice.
	   ``I don't want that to happen,'' he said. ``We have an important
agenda for the American people we have to tend to. And every day
that this is delayed is making that a little more difficult.''
	   But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Supreme Court ``should
be the final word.''
	   ``I think everybody in America would respect that,'' he said.
	   After a month of uncertainty over who would be president,
lawmakers started to weigh how the president would be able to
govern after the bitter election. And despite the oft-stated
recognition that Congress needs to close ranks behind whomever is
elected, the partisan divisions stood out in stark relief.
	   While some Republicans have said that if elected, Bush should
shy away from pursuing his proposed $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut,
saying it is too polarizing, Lott said he thought Bush should seek
large tax-rate reductions to keep the economy growing.
	   But Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said
on Sunday, ``I don't think that's possible.''
	   Daschle said on CBS that a drive by a Bush administration for
the full tax cut would send a signal that the calls for
bipartisanship were not serious.
	   Daschle said Democrats would support some tax cuts, but added:
``I don't think we would ever go to the magnitude that George Bush
has proposed. It would destroy the fiscal opportunities we have to
retire the debt in the not-to-distant future.''
