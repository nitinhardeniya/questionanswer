	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni investigators found bomb-making
equipment in a house near the port of Aden and believe two men who
spent <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-17" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">several days</TIMEX2> there are linked to the bombing of the USS Cole,
security officials said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>.

	   The officials identified the men, who have disappeared, only as
non-Yemeni Arabs. Other Yemeni officials said they were Saudi.

	   The disclosure comes <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day after Yemen reversed its earlier
position and called the blast that killed 17 Americans ``a
premeditated criminal act.''</TIMEX2>

	   The new stance gave a crucial boost to the investigation. The
country's security forces interrogated dozens of port workers and
others on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, including the head of the company that services
U.S. warships.

	   The security officials said the house was searched <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> and
bomb-making materials were found. The officials did not elaborate on
what the materials were.

	   The officials said the men were believed to have entered Yemen
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four days before <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>'s bombing</TIMEX2>. They did not say which country
the men had traveled from.

	   There has been no credible claim of responsibility for the
deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since the <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>
bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia that killed 19.

	   But immediate suspicion fell on terrorist mastermind Osama bin
Laden _ accused in the <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2> bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania that killed 224 people. <TIMEX2 val="1998-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">That August</TIMEX2>, the United States fired
dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles on eastern Afghanistan in an
attempt to kill bin Laden.

	   In his first statement since <TIMEX2 val="1988-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 1998</TIMEX2>, bin Laden warned
against another attack. He said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> that an attack would not kill
him and vowed to continue his battle against the ``enemies of
Islam.'' He made no direct reference to the Yemen attack, but
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> denied bin Laden was involved.

	   U.S. officials believe the attackers brought an explosives-laden
small boat near the Cole and detonated it in a suicide attack. Two
men were seen standing up in the small boat before the explosion,
official have said.

	   Many Yemenis have said they do not believe the attack was the
result of a homegrown plot, and <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>'s disclosures put the
spotlight on neighboring Saudi Arabia.

	   <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">Decades</TIMEX2> of border disputes have marred relations between Yemen
and Saudi Arabia. The two countries signed an agreement in <TIMEX2 val="2000-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June</TIMEX2> to
settle the disputes. Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to
three Red Sea islands and parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert
region with potentially lucrative oil deposits.

	   Meanwhile, four of the U.S. sailors seriously injured in the
apparent suicide bombing of the Cole were flown home <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> from
Germany, leaving behind two critically ill shipmates.

	   The three men and a woman arrived on an army bus and were carried
on stretchers onto a C-141 transport plane bound for a Norfolk, Va.,
naval base. One gave a thumbs-up to watching reporters. The sailors
had been treated at the U.S. military's Landstuhl Regional Medical
Center in western Germany since their arrival <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>.

	   Thirty-three other injured sailors returned to the United States
over <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the weekend</TIMEX2>, and 13 were released from a Virginia hospital by
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday afternoon</TIMEX2>.
