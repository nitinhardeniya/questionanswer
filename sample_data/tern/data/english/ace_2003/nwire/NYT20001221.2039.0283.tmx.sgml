STOCK PICKERS' MARKET? NOT NECESSARILY

	   ``It's a stock pickers' market.''
	   That comment is heard whenever actively managed stock mutual
funds beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index for any
appreciable length of time.
	   Investors will probably hear about the current ``stock pickers'
market'' soon enough. For <TIMEX2 val="P11M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="later context makes clear this is 11 months, not a period of 1 year">the year through Nov. 30</TIMEX2>, some 59 percent
of United States diversified equity funds beat the S&AMP;P 500,
according to Morningstar Inc. If enough of them can hold on to
their leads through <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 31</TIMEX2>, it will be the first time in <TIMEX2 val="P7Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">seven
years</TIMEX2> that active managers have beaten the S&AMP;P for <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a calendar year</TIMEX2>.
	   No matter that the average United States diversified stock fund
actually lost money over <TIMEX2 val="P11M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the 11 months</TIMEX2>, falling 6.31 percent. Given
that the S&AMP;P 500 has fallen 9.55 percent over <TIMEX2 val="P11M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the same period</TIMEX2>, it
does seem intuitive that most active managers are earning their pay
<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>.
	   Or maybe not. Instead of lumping together all those stock funds
and comparing them with the S&AMP;P 500, George U. Sauter, a managing
director of the Vanguard Group, divvied up the fund universe by
investing style _ value, growth and blend _ and then by average
market capitalization _ small, medium and large. He then compared
those nine categories with relevant benchmarks, not just the S&AMP;P
500.
	   ``It's very important to compare apples to apples,'' he said.
	   Sauter is hardly a disinterested party. He oversees $230 billion
in indexed stock mutual funds.
	   His research was through <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 31</TIMEX2>, but a look at Morningstar
figures through <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 30</TIMEX2> backs up the gist of what he found: Indexes
have given a good accounting of themselves. Only four of the nine
fund categories beat their benchmarks for <TIMEX2 val="P11M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-01" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="or ENDING 2000-11-30">the first 11 months of
2000</TIMEX2>. In the five other instances, the index beat the average fund
in its category, even if only by a fraction of a percentage point.
	   ``I think the story is that active managers were not as dumb as
everyone thought they were in <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2>,'' said Scott Cooley, a
Morningstar analyst. ``And they are not as smart as people seem to
be saying they are now.''
	   Before <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, large-cap stocks with high price-to-earnings
multiples led the bull market. These are the kinds of stocks that
dominate the S&AMP;P 500, which explains why most funds, which invest
in smaller stocks with lower P/Es, had lagged behind this index
until <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>.
	   The study compared fund categories to the S&AMP;P 500, S&AMP;P Mid-Cap
400, and S&AMP; P SmallCap 600, as well as the Barra value and growth
versions of those benchmarks.
	   Investors can quibble over plenty of points in comparing indexes
and funds. The cash positions held by active fund managers serve as
a cushion in a down market, giving them an advantage over indexers,
who hold little or no cash. Some experts say that comparing funds
to indexes is inherently unfair because of transaction and other
costs that funds incur. Others say such studies should use
after-tax returns, because trading by active managers generates
more taxable gains.
	   But a look at long-term returns turns up some numbers that may
vex ndex fans. While seven of the nine fund categories beat their
respective S&AMP;P indexes over <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="I bet they mean four years and 11 monhs, but I took them literally">the five years ended Nov. 30</TIMEX2>, two did
not. The average small-cap blend fund returned 11.69 percent,
annualized, over <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the period</TIMEX2>, versus 11.32 percent for the S&AMP;P
SmallCap 600 Index. The average small-cap growth fund returned
12.72 percent, annualized, versus 8.88 percent for the S&AMP;P SmallCap
600 Barra Growth index.
	   Indexing proponents say that in these cases, the outperformance
of active small-cap managers is caused by ``style drift,'' their
tendency to hold winning stocks as they grow into mid-cap and even
large-cap equities.
	   Still, maybe indexing proponents should face something else:
Many active small-cap managers add value above the indexes _
whether because they have dibs on popular initial offerings, hold
on to their winners or choose good stocks.
	   ``I find it hard to believe this is the one field of human
endeavor where talent is irrelevant,'' Cooley said.
