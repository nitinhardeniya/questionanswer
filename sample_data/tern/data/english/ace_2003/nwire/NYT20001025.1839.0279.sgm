	   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry was arrested Wednesday for
violating his probation after he slipped out of a Tampa drug
clinic, where he had been under house arrest, and spent four hours
smoking crack cocaine and popping Xanax pills, Florida prison
officials said.
	   Strawberry, who is fighting colon cancer, has been on probation
in Florida since he was convicted of possessing cocaine in May
1999. He was also suspended from baseball this season for cocaine
abuse. He has not played since last year's World Series, in which
he was a pinch-hitter for the New York Yankees, and at 38 he no
longer seems to have a viable future as a baseball player.
	   The former outfielder was arrested at a private drug treatment
center in Tampa Wednesday and sent to the Hillsborough County Jail,
where he was being held without bail, said Debbie Buchanan, a
spokesman for the Florida Department of Corrections.
	   Prison officials filed a motion in Hillsborough County Court
Wednesday requesting that Strawberry be sentenced to 30 days in the
county jail and then sent back to the drug clinic for the remainder
of his two years of probation. They are also asking a judge to
order Strawberry to wear an electronic bracelet that would allow
his parole officer to track his movements.
	   The arrest was the latest turn in the downward spiral
Strawberry's life has taken since he was diagnosed with colon
cancer just before the World Series two years ago. He underwent
surgery and chemotherapy, and rejoined the team the following
spring. But in May 1999 a Tampa police officer arrested him on
charges of soliciting a prostitute and possessing drugs. He was
sentenced to a year and a half of probation. Baseball suspended him
for three months, but he returned in September 1999 and played
through the World Series.
	   Last February, he failed a drug test required by Major League
Baseball and Commissioner Bud Selig suspended him for the 2000
season. In August, his colon cancer returned and he underwent
surgery to remove a second tumor.
	   Last month, Strawberry was arrested by an off-duty police
officer in Tampa after he blacked out and drove his car through a
street sign and into the rear of car stopped at a red light. He
later admitted that he had been under the influence of powerful
sleeping pills and painkillers he was taking as part of his cancer
treatment.
	   Strawberry could have been sent to jail for violating his
probation at that point, but Judge Florence Foster of the
Hillsborough County Court sentenced him instead to two years of
house arrest, to be served at a drug treatment clinic. He was
prohibited from leaving the center without permission from his
probation officer, Shelley Tomlinson.
	   But on Saturday night, Strawberry slipped away from the clinic
without permission around 11 p.m., officials said. He did not come
back until 3 a.m. Later that day, he admitted to Tomlinson that he
had smoked cocaine with ``a woman named Christine'' and had taken
ten pills of Xanax, a tranquilizer prescribed by doctors for
anxiety, according to court papers.
	   Heralded early in his career as a potential hall of famer,
Strawberry never fulfilled the promise of his first year as a
professional in 1983, when he started for the New York Mets and was
named the National League Rookie of the Year. He has a career
batting average of .259, with 335 home runs, but his journey
through the major leagues has been hampered by many personal
problems, ranging from alcoholism and drug addiction to convictions
on criminal charges and tax evasion.
