Injured U.S. Sailors Heading Home

	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ Thirty-three U.S. sailors
injured in an attack on their ship in Yemen headed home <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> after
treatment by military doctors in Germany, but six shipmates who were
more seriously hurt stayed behind.

	   Wearing donated track suits against the <TIMEX2 val="2000-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">fall</TIMEX2> chill, the sailors
gave thumbs-up signs as they boarded the gray C-141 plane taking them
to a Norfolk, Va., air base. Most were well enough to clamber up the
rear ramp, but several were taken aboard on stretchers, including one
brought by ambulance to the waiting plane.

	   All were eager to rejoin loved ones after <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>'s apparent
suicide bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen, that left 17
shipmates dead. The injured were evacuated <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> to the U.S.
military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.

	   ``The sailors are in good spirits,'' said Capt. Richard Thornell,
flight commander for the medical evacuation unit handling the trip
home. ``They are more rested and anxious to get home and see their
families.''

	   Some waved to waiting reporters as they left the Landstuhl
hospital, set among peaceful fir forests in a western corner of
Germany. Asked how they felt, one shouted: ``Great!'' Were they happy
to be going home? ``Absolutely!''

	   Shortly after <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15T13:30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1:30 p.m.</TIMEX2>, their plane roared into the sky from
Ramstein for the estimated <TIMEX2 val="PT9H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-15T13:30" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">nine-hour</TIMEX2> flight home. Three nurses
accompanied the injured on board.

	   Most of the injured suffered cuts and bruises, broken bones or
eye injuries. Others limped as they got off buses that brought them
from the hospital to the air base. A female officer _ the only
officer among the injured _ had one arm in a cast; another sailor
wore an eye patch.

	   Petty Officer 3rd Class Johann Gokool of Miami was transported by
ambulance after undergoing major foot surgery until <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15TMO" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early morning</TIMEX2>.

	   Many of the injured sailors also suffered emotional shock,
according to doctors and chaplains who talked to them at Landstuhl.

	   Hospital officials said earlier that 34 sailors were cleared to
return home <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, but doctors later decided one of those couldn't
travel yet. Among the seriously injured was one sailor with a
punctured lung, another with burns and several with complicated bone
fractures.

	   ``They're a little bit more sick and need stabilization,''
Thornell said.

	   The United States says 17 sailors were killed and 39 injured in
the attack on the USS Cole during a refueling stop.

	   On <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>, a military transport flew the bodies of five sailors
killed in the attack back to the United States from Ramstein, a way
station en route from the Middle East.
