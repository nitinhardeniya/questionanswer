	   <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Six years ago</TIMEX2>, Sen. Joseph Lieberman was instrumental in
derailing stricter accounting rules on stock options. And with
businesses facing new accounting rules on acquisitions that could
hurt their bottom line, Lieberman, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T21:36:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> the Democratic vice
presidential candidate, joined 12 other senators <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this year</TIMEX2>
in pushing for a delay of the new rules.
	   The musings of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
private-sector body based in Norwalk, Conn., that sets the nation's
accounting standards, are rarely of interest to the movers and
shakers in Washington _ except when influential executives start
complaining. Investors clearly do not have friends in such high
places.
	   The board is considering the elimination of a popular accounting
technique that allows companies to avoid good-will charges that
reduce reported profits. The technique, known as pooling of
interests, is frequently used by large technology companies, which
argue that the elimination of this method would hurt their ability
to make acquisitions that fuel their growth. But the technique has
also been criticized for not giving investors information about
these acquisitions.
	   Concerned about the effect of new rules, Lieberman joined 12
other senators in writing a letter in <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late September</TIMEX2> to the
accounting board. ``As United States senators concerned about the
continued innovation and growth of the U.S. technology sector, we
urge FASB to postpone any final decision regarding the pooling
accounting method until the various alternatives to improve
financial reporting have been fully considered,'' the senators
wrote.
	   Although the board had already said it would delay its decision
until <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early next year</TIMEX2>, the senators asked the board for ``assurance
that FASB will take no conclusive action on its current project on
business combinations until Congress has reconvened in <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2001</TIMEX2> and had
the opportunity to review the economic impact of FASB's plans at
<TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="coref with preceding 2001">that time</TIMEX2>.''
	   These senators are not the only ones getting into the act. Two
California representatives, Christopher Cox, a Republican, and Cal
Dooley, a Democrat, introduced a bill <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this month</TIMEX2> that would allow
companies to use pooling for <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">a year</TIMEX2> while there is further study of
the issue.
	   Washington's rush to protect the high-technology industry has
met with criticism from those who believe the work of the
accounting board should remain out of the political fray. The
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T21:36:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> efforts by Congress represent ``blatant government
intervention in the private sector to serve the selfish interests
of the technology industries,'' argued Jack T. Ciesielski, an
analyst in Baltimore who specializes in accounting issues. What
concerns him is the possibility that the board's decisions will
become more about politics than good accounting. Whenever the board
tackles a controversial accounting issue, ``companies are going to
go to Congress,'' he said.
	   The last political victory took place <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">six years ago</TIMEX2>, on the
accounting board's proposed rule on stock options. Lieberman is
credited with derailing the board's plans to require companies to
expense the value of stock options by proposing legislation that
would have virtually put the accounting board out of business.
	   The board eventually backed down, choosing instead to require
companies to disclose more information about the options they were
handing out. ``The board elected to come up with a second-best
answer in order to live to fight another day,'' said Dennis R.
Beresford, an accounting professor at the University of Georgia who
was then chairman of the accounting board.
	   But businesses were emboldened by their success and are <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T21:36:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>
quick to lobby politicians when they are faced with accounting
standards they dislike, said Edmund L. Jenkins, the board's current
chairman. Businesses, he said, ``are using the political process to
try to achieve their desires; I think that is unfortunate.''
	   Jenkins is opposed to the proposed legislation to retain pooling
for <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">a year</TIMEX2>. While the bill does not call for a specific solution,
the enforced delay in rules that would provide investors with
better information ``is interfering with the private-sector
standard-setting process,'' he argued.
	   He is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T21:36:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> in the position of trying to persuade Congress that
the accounting board is doing nothing in haste. Noting that the
board has been reviewing merger accounting for <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">four years</TIMEX2> and has
held dozens of public meetings, as well as <TIMEX2 val="P4D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">four days of public
hearings</TIMEX2>, Jenkins wrote the senators <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T21:36:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> that ``we are
certainly not rushing to any final conclusions.''
	   And four representatives, all of them accountants, including E.
Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican, and Brad Sherman, a California
Democrat, have also come out against the proposed legislation. ``It
is critical that accounting standard-setting remains insulated from
the influence of special interest groups and politics to ensure
that accounting standards, and the resulting financial reporting,
continue to provide investors with an unbiased and informative
picture of a company's activities,'' the four wrote in a letter to
their colleagues.
	   Unlike the stock-option debate, where business opposition to the
new rules was nearly universal, opinion is much more divided about
merger accounting. What is more, the board is considering rules
that in some cases would allow companies to avoid expensing good
will, which would address the major concern over the elimination of
pooling.
	   As for Lieberman, he is unlikely to push for legislation in the
case of merger accounting, said Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for the
senator. The senator's decision to propose legislation as a way of
blocking new rules concerning stock options was a ``last resort,''
Gerstein explained, because the rule would have had such dire
consequences for the economy _ at least if one listened to the
rule's critics.
	   The real question is whether Lieberman and others will allow the
accounting board to come to its own conclusions <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2> _ far
away from <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>'s elections and from Washington.
