Accused U.S. Spy Makes Demand

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A defense lawyer for U.S. businessman Edmond Pope
demanded on Monday that a prosecutor in the espionage case be
dismissed because his son was on the security team that investigated
the American.

	   The conflict of interest made the entire evidence presented in
the trial invalid, said Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov.

	   Astakhov said that a son of state prosecutor Oleg Plotnikov was
an officer of the Federal Security Service and on the team of
investigators that brought the case to court. Astakhov said the law
obliged Plotnikov to step down and urged the court to dismiss him.

	   ``For four weeks, we have taken part in a trial in which the
state prosecutor was biased,'' Astakhov told reporters.

	   Pope is being tried in a closed court on charges he sought to
obtain classified plans for a high-speed Russian submarine torpedo.
Pope denies the charges, and relatives and supporters have said the
plans were already sold abroad and weren't secret. One of Pope's key
accusers has recanted a statement that implicated him in espionage.

	   But a government commission concluded that the plans, parts of
which Pope received before his arrest, were in fact classified.
However, another group of experts ruled that the materials weren't
classified when Pope requested them.

	   Plotnikov did not show up at the trial on Monday, citing high
blood pressure. A different prosecutor, Yuri Volgin, refused to
comment on Astakhov's allegations, and the court said it would make a
decision concerning Plotnikov on Tuesday.

	   The U.S. government has urged Russia to release Pope, saying
authorities have failed to show he did anything illegal, and because
he is in poor health. Pope has suffered from bone cancer, which was
in remission when he came to Moscow. His supporters fear the cancer
may have returned.

	   Pope, 54, of State College, Pa., is a retired U.S. Navy officer
and founder of CERF Technologies International, a company
specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment.
