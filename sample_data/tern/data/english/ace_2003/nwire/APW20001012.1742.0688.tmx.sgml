	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The German subsidiary of British Airways
said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> it would fight Lufthansa's plans to take a stake in
another domestic airline, calling it a ``dangerous monopolization''
of Germany's skies.

	   Lufthansa said <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2> it would buy a 24.9 percent stake in
commuter airline Eurowings to offer customers in Germany's biggest
state, North Rhine-Westphalia, more direct connections to European
business centers.

	   Lufthansa has said it would raise its stake if competition
authorities agree.

	   Deutsche BA head Adrian Hunt said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> he was speaking to
European Union authorities and the Transport Ministry about the
ramifications of Lufthansa controlling 80 percent of internal German
flights.

	   Hunt said he had also written to German antitrust officials
accusing Lufthansa of unfairly cutting prices on competitive routes.
