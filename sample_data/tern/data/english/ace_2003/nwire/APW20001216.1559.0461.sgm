Edmond Pope Heading Home

	   BERLIN (AP) _ U.S. businessman Edmond Pope was discharged
Saturday from a U.S. military hospital where he had been undergoing
tests since his release after months in a Russian prison on espionage
charges, a hospital spokeswoman said.

	   Pope, the first American convicted of espionage in Russia in 40
years, will be heading home Sunday or Monday. He was pardoned
Thursday by Russian President Vladimir Putin and immediately flew to
Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

	   ``If he is discharged, he is in good condition,'' said Marie
Shaw, a spokeswoman at the hospital in Landstuhl, near Frankfurt.

	   Pope, 54, has suffered in the past from a rare form of bone
cancer, and doctors said Friday it was unclear if it had resurfaced.
They also ran tests for three lesions that were possible skin cancer.

	   Shaw said she did not know the results of those tests and could
not release any information without Pope's consent.

	   Pope, who was held for 253 days before his release, was to leave
for the United States on a regular flight, Shaw said. His first
destination will be Oregon, where his mother is caring for his ailing
father, Shaw said.

	   ``He's very concerned about his father,'' she said. The Popes
intend to be back in their hometown of State College, Penn. for
Christmas.

	   Until his departure, Pope is staying with his wife, Cheri, in a
hotel located on Ramstein Air Base, which he is entitled to use
because he is a retired U.S. Navy officer.

	   ``He's happy and eating well, relaxing with his wife,'' Shaw
said.

	   Pope was sentenced to 20 years in jail by a Moscow court on Dec.
6. He has denied the charges that he obtained secret torpedo
technology, saying the information has been published.

	   He was in a business meeting in Moscow for his company, CERF
Technologies International, last April when a dozen security agents
stormed in and arrested him and the Russians who were in the room.

	   Pope said Friday he had not been mistreated while in Moscow's
high-security Lefortovo prison, but the lack of vitamins from his
bland diet of porridge, potatoes, fish and soup took a toll on his
health.

	   ``There was no physical abuse,'' he said. ``They were extremely
careful with me. It was clear to my after a while that I was there
for political reasons.''
