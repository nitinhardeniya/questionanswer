Ecologist Could Sway W. Va. Vote

	   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) _ Novelist, lay preacher,
environmentalist. Denise Giardina doesn't have a politician's resume,
yet her maverick campaign may help decide the West Virginia
governor's race.

	   The two leading candidates in the closely contested vote are
Republican Gov. Cecil Underwood and Democrat Bob Wise, a nine-term
congressman.

	   But Wise may lose some support on the left to Giardina, who has
campaigned loudly against the state's powerful coal industry,
specifically its use of mountaintop removal strip mining.

	   That message may resonate with West Virginians. On Oct. 11, the
bottom dropped out of a mountaintop coal-sludge pond, releasing 250
million gallons of the black goo, killing fish and fouling drinking
water along 60 miles of the Kentucky-West Virginia line.

	   ``We're really at a crossing point and a turning point in this
state,'' Giardina said. ``The coal industry is on its way out. That's
definite. It don't see any politician willing to deal with that.''

	   Underwood and Wise have said they support mountaintop removal if
coal companies comply with state and federal laws.

	   Giardina, 49, has been a Republican and a Democrat and is running
as an independent out of frustration with both parties. She also
agreed to help form what is being called the Mountain Party.

	   Before she began campaigning in the spring of 1999, Giardina was
a little-known but respected author, a lay preacher in the Episcopal
Church and writer-in-residence and instructor at West Virginia State
College, where she continues to teach.

	   She recently sold the film rights to her latest book, ``Saints
and Villains,'' about Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German theologian
executed by the Nazis for plotting against Hitler.

	   Bonhoeffer and the main characters in her other books _
``Storming Heaven'' and ``The Unquiet Earth,'' about the development
of the coal industry in West Virginia, and ``Good King Harry'' about
Henry V of England _ do what is morally right at great personal risk.

	   If Giardina receives 1 percent of the vote, the Mountain Party
will be able to run candidates in the next election without having to
petition for ballot access. Ironically, Giardina may not immediately
join the party and has no plans to help it grow.

	   ``I'm not a party organizer. It's a different role,'' she said.

	   The race between Wise and Underwood is too close to call and
Giardina's candidacy has split the state's progressive community.
Polls suggest she could get about 3 percent of the votes, a
potentially crippling blow to Wise, who was once a friend and
colleague.

	   They worked together in the late 1970s on an Appalachian land
ownership study aimed at getting coal companies to pay more taxes.
She volunteered in Wise's first congressional campaign in 1982 and
later worked in his district office.

	   ``Any candidate who has a capacity to take several percentage
points can determine what happens in that race,'' Wise said. ``I
think Denise Giardina has some important things to say.

	   ``The real tragedy is going to be if in saying them she amounts
to re-electing the person that is most opposite to what she believes.
Then we all lose,'' he said.
