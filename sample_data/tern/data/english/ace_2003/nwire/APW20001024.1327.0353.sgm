U.S. Troops in Mideast on Alert

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ American forces in Turkey and two small Persian
Gulf states are on a heightened state of alert because of new
indications of terrorist threats in the region, senior defense
officials said Tuesday.

	   One official, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity,
described the move as precautionary.

	   ``The reason it was done was the receipt of specific threats
against U.S. forces in those areas, but from sources whose
credibility is unknown,'' the official said Monday in confirming a
report first aired by CBS News.

	   U.S. troops in Bahrain and Qatar in the Persian Gulf were placed
on the highest possible state of alert, and the Incirlik air base in
southern Turkey has been placed on the second-highest level of alert,
the official said Tuesday. The change in Bahrain and Qatar was made
over the weekend; Incirlik has been on a heightened level of alert
for more than a week, the official said.

	   Defense officials refused to discuss the nature of the threat
that prompted the security concerns.

	   Figuring in the decision to raise the alert level for troops in
those three areas was the bombing Oct. 12 of the USS Cole, which was
refueling in the Yemeni port of Aden when an explosion tore a hole in
its hull. Seventeen sailors were killed and 39 were injured in what
U.S. officials believe was the work of terrorists.

	   Given the surprise attack on the Cole, ``this was thought to be
the prudent thing to do,'' the official said.

	   Bahrain is headquarters for the U.S. Central Command's naval
forces and for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet. When the Cole was attacked,
Central Command officials ordered all 5th Fleet ships out of port as
a precaution against possible further attack, and they remained at
sea last week.

	   The Incirlik air base in Turkey is headquarters for the U.S. and
British air patrols that are enforcing a ``no fly'' zone over
northern Iraq.

	   There is only a limited U.S. military presence in Qatar, with a
small number of Air Force personnel stationed there. The United
States also has an embassy in Qatar.

	   Defense Secretary William Cohen said in response to the attack on
the Cole that U.S. forces would not retreat from the region, whose
oil supplies are vital to the American economy. Besides Turkey,
Bahrain and Qatar, the United States maintains forces in several
other areas of the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Oman.

	   A U.S. aircraft carrier also is kept on permanent station in the
Gulf.

	   Army Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the commander in chief of Central
Command, is due to testify before Congress on Wednesday _ along with
other military and Defense Department officials _ on the Cole
tragedy.

	   American forces in the Persian Gulf region operate year-round
under the threat of terrorism. In June 1996, a truck bomb ripped
through a housing complex for U.S. Air Force personnel near Dhahran,
Saudi Arabia, killing 19 Americans.
