Terrorists Said Major U.S. Threat

	   WSHINGTON (AP) _ The main threats to U.S. territory over the
coming 15 years will likely come from terrorists and other
adversaries using low-tech tools of war, according to a sweeping new
study by intelligence analysts and non-goverment experts.

	   This threat is made more worrisome by a trend toward increasing
collusion among terrorists, drug traffickers, weapons proliferators
and organized crime, according to the assessment ``Global Trends
2015,'' published Monday.

	   ``Most adversaries will recognize the information advantage and
military superiority of the United States in 2015,'' the report said.
``Rather than acquiesce to any potential U.S. military domination,
they will try to circumvent or minimize U.S. strengths and exploit
perceived weaknesses.''

	   The most recent example of this approach was the terrorist
bombing of the USS Cole on Oct. 12 as it refueled in Aden, Yemen. A
small boat maneuvered alongside the huge destroyer and, without
drawing attention from the ship's security forces, detonated
explosives that tore a hole in the ship and killed 17 sailors.

	   Monday's report said this kind of approach _ known as
``asymmetric warfare'' _ will threaten U.S. interests not only abroad
but also at home.

	   ``Such asymmetric approaches _ whether undertaken by states or
nonstate actors _ will become the dominant characteristic of most
threats to the U.S. homeland,'' the report said. This will become the
``defining challenge'' of U.S. national security strategy and
military force development in coming years.

	   High-tech threats also will loom large, the report said.

	   ``Advances in science and technology will pose national security
challenges of uncertain character and scale,'' it said. ``Increasing
reliance on computer networks is making critical U.S. infrastructures
more attractive as targets. Computer network operations today offer
new options for attacking the United States within its traditional
continental sanctuary, potentially anonymously and with selective
effects.''

	   Highlights of the study were first reported in Monday's editions
of the New York Times and Washington Post. The Times said copies of
the report were given last week to President-elect Bush's team.

	   The assessment also looked at global economic, political, and
resource trends.

	   It predicted that Russia would continue to face problems. It will
be ``challenged even more than today to adjust its expectations for
world leadership to its dramatically reduced resources.'' The report
concluded that the most likely outcome is that Russia will remain
internally weak through 2015.

	   The experts had a mixed view of China. ``Working against China's
aspirations to sustain economic growth while preserving its political
system is an array of political, social, and economic pressures that
will increasingly challenge the regime's legitimacy, and perhaps its
survival,'' they concluded. On the other hand, China may introduce
enough political reform to adapt to domestic pressure for change.

	   The report was 15 months in the making and was directed by the
National Intelligence Council, a group of intelligence officials
representing all elements of the U.S. national security
establishment, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense
Intelligence Agency and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence
and Research. Also contributing were experts from private think tanks
and academic institutions.
