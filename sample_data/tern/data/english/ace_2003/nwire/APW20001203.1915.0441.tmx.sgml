Lawmakers Poised for Special Session

	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) _ The Republican-controlled Legislature is
poised to hold a special session <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> to try to enforce George
W. Bush's certified victory in Florida by naming the state's 25
electors, the House majority leader said.

	   But Senate President John McKay said he isn't ready to sign a
proclamation convening the session despite House Majority Leader Mike
Fasano's statement <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX2> that both leaders would do so
on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>.

	   ``There are so many uncertainties contingent upon actions outside
the control of the Legislature that we must proceed with the utmost
caution,'' McKay said in a statement. ``This is perhaps the most
important issue that the Legislature will ever face. The Senate will
not be rushed to judgment. We have only one chance to get this
right.''

	   House Speaker Tom Feeney has said he is ready to call for the
session, and Fasano said the speaker told him a proclamation would be
signed <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> and the session would begin <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>.

	   McKay said later, however, that he is still waiting to review a
committee report recommending the session. ``I will not call a
special session on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>,'' he said.

	   Fasano said <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday evening</TIMEX2> that he either had misspoke or was
misunderstood <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier in the day</TIMEX2> and that the only definitive
information he got from a conversation with Feeney was that the House
speaker intended to sign a proclamation on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> to open the session
on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>.

	   ``Speaker Feeney does intend to sign the proclamation on
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>,'' Fasano said. ``That's exactly what the speaker told me.''

	   The Republican-controlled Legislature is considering appointing
the 25 electors through a resolution that would spare Gov. Jeb Bush
from having to sign legislation helping his brother.

	   Republican Sen. Jim King said there were preliminary discussions
with Fasano in which different potential schedules for a special
session were discussed and <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> was among the possibilities. But
until McKay has a chance to study the issue, there is no set starting
date, King said.

	   ``What happened here is a colossal case of assumption,'' King
said.

	   ``Tom Feeney in his heart of hearts and in the marrow of his
bones thinks he needs to take action. John McKay in the marrow of his
bones says, 'I am going to be deliberative, this is the most
important thing the Florida legislature has ever done.'''

	   Republican lawmakers argued the Constitution makes the
legislature responsible for naming electors, and requires them to do
so if there's a chance the state's vote might not be counted because
of a controversy. Democrats disagree.

	   House Democratic leader Lois Frankel said she was preparing for a
special session. ``We have our own constitutional obligation to be
there. ... We are going to be there to be voices of reason.''

	   She said the House Rules Committee chairman, Dudley Goodlette,
had told her to report to Tallahassee on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> for a meeting to go
over the rules for a special session.

	   Jeb Bush was in New York on personal business and unavailable for
comment <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>, but he previously has said he would sign
legislation to help his brother become president.

	   Despite legislative contortions to spare him from signing over
the state's 25 electoral votes to his brother, Jeb Bush's signature
is required on the official certificate sending the slate of electors
to the National Archives, constitutional experts said <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>.

	   The Florida governor has already signed a certified slate of
Republican electors. If the courts invalidate that slate, the
Republican-controlled Florida Legislature is prepared to override
with a Bush slate.

	   If Congress gets competing slates and the two chambers disagree
on which to accept _ a real possibility _ the slate signed by
Florida's governor then will prevail, said Florida State University
law professor Nat Stern.

	   University of Denver law professor Robert Hardaway, who has
written a book titled ``The Electoral College and the Constitution:
The Case for Preserving Federalism,'' concurred.

	   ``The endgame scenario would seem to favor the Bush campaign,''
Hardaway said.

	   Florida's governor and Legislature would be key players in such a
scenario that would arise only if a court-ordered recount erases
Bush's 537-vote lead in Florida and puts Gore ahead. If the election
decision fell to Congress, the tiebreaker would be the slate signed
by the governor, Hardaway and Stern said.

	   ``I've never heard of that,'' Senate majority Leader Jim King
said. ``I hope to God we don't go that far.''

	   Hardaway said the manner of the Legislature's selection, either a
resolution or bill, would make no difference in terms of a legal
challenge under federal law. Stern said he believed federal law would
prevail over state law for such a challenge.

	   The Legislature last held a special session in <TIMEX2 val="2000-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January, when
lawmakers took <TIMEX2 val="P3D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-01" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">three days</TIMEX2> to pass laws making lethal injection the
primary method of execution over the electric chair</TIMEX2>.
