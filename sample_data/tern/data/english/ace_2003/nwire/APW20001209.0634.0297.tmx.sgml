Official Faults Cole Crew on Plan
</HEADLINE>

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The crew of the USS Cole did not implement all
of the self-protection measures the ship's skipper had drawn up
before it was hit by a terrorist bomb in Aden harbor in Yemen, a
senior defense official said.

	   It could not be learned, however, whether Navy investigators had
determined that the attack, which killed 17 sailors, might have been
averted if the Cole's security plan had been implemented in full.

	   The defense official, who discussed the matter <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> on
condition of anonymity, said it was too early to know whether the
Navy would hold anyone from the Cole accountable.

	   The crew's failure to fully implement its written security plan
was first reported <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> by CNN, which quoted an unnamed Pentagon
official as saying regarding the crew's implementation of a security
plan, ``They didn't do everything they said they were going to do.''
The New York Times posted a similar report on its Web site <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>.

	   Two men in a small boat loaded with explosives maneuvered next to
the 505-foot destroyer as the ship refueled in Aden harbor <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 12</TIMEX2>.
The explosives detonated and ripped an enormous hole in the Cole's
hull.

	   In <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W41" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the weeks</TIMEX2> since, investigators have focused on whether the
Cole had taken prudent security precautions and whether security
activities spelled out in its operating plans were followed in all
respects.

	   Details of the Cole's self-protection plan, which were approved
by higher-level commanders, have never been revealed.

	   If Navy investigators determine that important security measures
were not taken, Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, the Cole's captain, could be held
accountable and his career damaged, officials said. Navy officials
stressed that the investigation is not complete and that preliminary
conclusions are subject to change.

	   ``The public and the press need to avoid a rush to judgment''
about the outcome of the probe, said Rear Adm. Stephen Pietropaoli,
the Navy's chief of information. ``The investigation continues.''

	   The Navy investigative report was transmitted <TIMEX2 val="2000-W49" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> from 5th
Fleet headquarters in Bahrain to Adm. Robert Natter, commander in
chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command in Norfolk, Va. From there it will
go for a final judgment to Adm. Vern Clark, chief of naval operations
at Navy headquarters in the Pentagon.

	   Clark said this week that he would not comment on the
investigation.

	   Lippold, who previously served as an aide to Navy Secretary
Richard Danzig, is highly regarded in the Navy. He has been credited,
along with his crew, with saving the Cole from sinking in <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-12" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the days
after the blast</TIMEX2>, which knocked out the ship's power and threatened to
tear it nearly in half.

	   Separately, the FBI is investigating who was behind the attack.
It has not reported any conclusion, although Yemen's prime minister,
Abdul-Karim al-Iryani, said <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> that at least three Yemenis
suspected of belonging to an international terrorist network will go
on trial <TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next month</TIMEX2> in connection with the attack.

	   The crippled Cole is now crossing the Atlantic Ocean aboard the
heavy-lift ship Blue Marlin and is due to arrive at Litton Ingalls
Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, where it will
undergo repairs estimated at $200 million.
