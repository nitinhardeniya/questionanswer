Canadiens Change GM, Coach

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Hoping it's not too late to avoid missing the
playoffs for the third straight season, the Montreal Canadiens opted
for a fresh start Monday.

	   The team with the most championships in NHL history _ and
currently the 30-team league's worst record (5-13-2) _ fired its
coach, Alain Vigneault, and general manager, Rejean Houle.

	   Michel Therrien takes over on the bench, and Andre Savard is the
new GM.

	   ``The bottom line is this game is played with a lot of passion,''
said Therrien, who was coaching Montreal's AHL affiliate, the Quebec
Citadelles. ``This is one thing that myself and Guy are going to try
to bring to our players _ our passion and emotion. We're going to
start with something, and this is what we're going to start with.''

	   In other moves, former Canadiens captain Guy Carbonneau was
appointed assistant coach, while scout Martin Madden was made the
assistant GM.

	   Montreal takes a five-game losing streak into a game Tuesday
night against visiting Florida.

	   The Canadiens, owners of a record 24 Stanley Cup titles, have
missed the postseason two straight times _ something that hadn't
happened since 1922.

	   ``As a result of our very poor results, we came to the conclusion
that we needed to move quickly and somewhat radically with respect to
our hockey administration,'' Canadiens president Pierre Boivin told a
news conference.

	   Therrien plans to change the team's style.

	   ``People who know me from the past know that I like an aggressive
team that plays in-your-face hockey,'' Therrien said. ``I like a team
that finishes checks, that's tough to play against.

	   ``The game is going with speed. I really believe in having good
speed. But it doesn't take a lot to have a fast team. The top two
lines see a lot of ice time. One or two players can make a
difference.''

	   The team was lambasted by the Montreal media on Sunday after a
6-1 loss to Toronto.

	   ``Embarrassment Night in Canada,'' the Montreal Gazette said.

	   ``Disgusting,'' read the headline in Le Journal de Montreal.

	   The team is up for sale and Boivin has said he expects the club
to be sold before the end of the year. But for now, he expects the
team to do better, noting the budget is not frozen.

	   ``We are committed to doing whatever is required, of course
within reason, to strengthen the team if there are opportunities to
do so,'' he said.

	   Savard rejected the idea of trading away veterans to acquire
draft picks to rebuild the club.

	   ``We won't liquidate the team,'' he said.

	   Carbonneau and Savard were hired in September _ Carbonneau as
Montreal's head of prospect development and Savard, a former Ottawa
Senators scouting director and assistant coach, as Houle's right-hand
man.

	   Houle was in his sixth season as GM, succeeding Serge Savard in
1995. Now, with no great postseason success to show, Houle may well
be best remembered as the man who traded goalie Patrick Roy.

	   In an emotional speech, Houle acknowledged that he may have taken
on more than he was prepared to handle when he originally accepted
the job.

	   ``What hurt me was my lack of experience at the start, and then
having to play catch-up,'' Houle said.

	   Vigneault was nominated for the Jack Adams Trophy as coach of the
year last season. He took a team beset by injuries from last place to
within two points of a playoff spot.

	   ``I'm confident that this new team will inspire our players, and
put our team back on the road to victory,'' Boivin said.

	   Said Houle: ``For the first time, I'll wake up in the morning
without a job. I don't know how I'll react.''
