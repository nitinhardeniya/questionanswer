Gen. Zinni Takes Blame for USS Cole
</HEADLINE>

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Yemeni coastline, where the USS Cole met
disaster in an apparent terrorist bombing <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>, is a ``sieve''
for terrorists but was the best option available for refueling Navy
ships in the volatile region, the former U.S. military commander in
the region said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>.

	   Gen. Anthony Zinni, who was commander in chief of U.S. Central
Command at <TIMEX2 val="1998-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the time the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in
the Yemeni port of Aden in <TIMEX2 val="1998-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 1998</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, took responsibility for the
decision.

	   ``I pass that buck on to nobody,'' Zinni told a Senate Armed
Services Committee hearing.

	   Zinni, who retired earlier <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, said he and the rest of the
American government were well aware that terrorists use Yemen as a
transit route into Saudi Arabia.

	   ``Their coast is a sieve,'' he said.

	   Yet there were no better alternatives and Navy ships must refuel
in that area while moving to and from the Persian Gulf, Zinni said.
The port of Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa and just across the Gulf
of Aden from Yemen, had been used but the refueling contract there
was terminated in <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about 1997</TIMEX2> because the facilities were
unsatisfactory and ``the threat conditions were far worse.''

	   That left him with ``options that were not very good,'' Zinni
said.

	   The retired general told the committee that he personally checked
on the refueling arrangements in a series of visits to Aden between
<TIMEX2 val="1998-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May 1998</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="2000-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May 2000</TIMEX2>.

	   <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Each time</TIMEX2>, Zinni said, it was clear to him that the Yemeni
government was sincere in wanting American help in controlling its
coastline. Zinni said his chief of security also visited Aden in <TIMEX2 val="1998-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May
1998</TIMEX2> to check on security arrangements.

	   Zinni said Aden was one of the few ports in the region where U.S.
intelligence had not detected specific threats to American interests.
The threat conditions in Yemen, he said, ``were actually better than
we had elsewhere,'' including Saudi Arabia.

	   While the Senate committee began to examine the circumstances
behind the Navy's use of Aden as a refueling stop, the Pentagon was
preparing to move ahead with its own investigation.

	   A retired Navy admiral, Harold W. Gehman, and a retired Army
general, William Crouch, will head an independent investigation of
security practices on the USS Cole at the time the ship was hit by an
apparent terrorist attack <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 12</TIMEX2>.

	   Meantime, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet, Adm. Robert
Natter, said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> he is very confident that those responsible for
the attack will be found, and he added that they must be punished.
``We have got to go and attack the enemy.''

	   ``There has been an attack on U.S. sovereign territory _ that
U.S. Navy warship. That's sovereign territory,'' Natter said on NBC's
``Today.'' ``If we are going to defend ourselves, we have got to go
on the attack.

	   ``You cannot continue to allow yourself to be attacked and
attempt to defend yourself without at some point saying 'this is
inappropriate,''' Natter said.

	   The Pentagon planned to announce on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> that Defense
Secretary William Cohen had requested the probe be led by Gehman, who
retired <TIMEX2 val="2000-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this summer</TIMEX2> as commander in chief of U.S. Joint Forces
Command, and Crouch, who retired in <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1999</TIMEX2> as Army deputy chief of
staff, a senior defense official said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

	   Crouch also is a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T15:14:06" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> commander of U.S. Army Europe and chief
of NATO's Allied Land Forces Central Europe. In that capacity he
commanded the U.S.-led NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">97</TIMEX2>, a
mission that placed a high priority on troop security, or ``force
protection measures,'' in military parlance.

	   Gehman had extensive at-sea experience during his career,
including tours in Vietnam and as commander of a destroyer. He later
served as vice chief of naval operations, the No. 2 post in the Navy.

	   The investigation will examine the circumstances <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">at the time of
the <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 12</TIMEX2> bombing in Aden, Yemen</TIMEX2>, and assess ways in which standard
security precautions during visits to foreign ports can be improved.

	   Natter, the fleet commander, said: ``To my knowledge, I'm very
pleased with what the ship was doing with respect to self-defense.''
But he declined to say whether he has seen evidence of a security
lapse, saying that is the purpose of the investigation.

	   The probe will be independent of the FBI's ongoing investigation
of who carried out the attack.

	   U.S. officials believe that a small boat sidled up to the Cole
while it was preparing to refuel in the middle of Aden's harbor and
detonated a bomb powerful enough to rip a hole 40 feet high and 40
feet wide in the Cole's hull. Seventeen sailors were killed and more
than 30 were injured.

	   The impact wrenched open hatches and buckled parts of the deck on
the <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">4-year-old</TIMEX2> destroyer, whose modern construction may have helped
it say afloat.

	   The Cole will have to be moved from Aden for major repairs by a
vessel known as a heavy lift ship, which is like a floating dry dock
capable of carrying ships of up to 30,000 tons. The unloaded Cole is
8,300 tons.

	   The Navy, meanwhile, said the bodies of two more American sailors
were recovered <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> from the Cole, and the search was to resume
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> for the last four missing bodies believed still aboard.

	   Over <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the weekend</TIMEX2>, the Navy sent a 22-member team of specialists
with 10 tons of equipment to cut through the twisted steel inside the
ship and find the sailors who were listed as missing. Navy officials
said they knew approximately where the bodies were but could not
reach them because of the extensive damage.

	   Lt. Cmdr. Cate Mueller, a Navy spokeswoman, said the two
additional remains _ along with six bodies recovered on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> _
were due to arrive at Dover Air Force Base, Del., on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>.

	   A port-side memorial service at Aden, the scene of the attack
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last Thursday</TIMEX2>, was held before the eight remains were taken aboard a
plane for the flight home, Mueller said.

	   The Pentagon released the names of two of the six bodies
recovered on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>. They are Ronald Scott Owens, 24, of Vero Beach,
Fla., and Kevin Shawn Rux, 30, of Portland, N.D. The other four sets
of remains recovered <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> as well as the two recovered <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>
had not yet been identified.

	   Five bodies were recovered <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> and were flown back to the
United States.

	   The presumed final death count of 17 makes this the worst
terrorist attack on the American military since a truck bomb ripped
through a U.S. Air Force housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,
in <TIMEX2 val="1996-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June 1996</TIMEX2>, killing 19 troops.
