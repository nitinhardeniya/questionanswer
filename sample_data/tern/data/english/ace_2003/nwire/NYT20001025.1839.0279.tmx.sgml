	   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry was arrested <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> for
violating his probation after he slipped out of a Tampa drug
clinic, where he had been under house arrest, and spent <TIMEX2 val="PT4H" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-21T23:00" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">four hours</TIMEX2>
smoking crack cocaine and popping Xanax pills, Florida prison
officials said.
	   Strawberry, who is fighting colon cancer, has been on probation
in Florida since he was convicted of possessing cocaine in <TIMEX2 val="1999-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May
1999</TIMEX2>. He was also suspended from baseball <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this season</TIMEX2> for cocaine
abuse. He has not played since <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>'s World Series, in which
he was a pinch-hitter for the New York Yankees, and at 38 he no
longer seems to have a viable future as a baseball player.
	   The <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-25T18:47:10" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> outfielder was arrested at a private drug treatment
center in Tampa <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> and sent to the Hillsborough County Jail,
where he was being held without bail, said Debbie Buchanan, a
spokesman for the Florida Department of Corrections.
	   Prison officials filed a motion in Hillsborough County Court
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> requesting that Strawberry be sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P30D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">30 days in the
county jail</TIMEX2> and then sent back to the drug clinic for <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the remainder
of <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">his two years of probation</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. They are also asking a judge to
order Strawberry to wear an electronic bracelet that would allow
his parole officer to track his movements.
	   The arrest was the latest turn in the downward spiral
Strawberry's life has taken since he was diagnosed with colon
cancer just before the World Series <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two years ago</TIMEX2>. He underwent
surgery and chemotherapy, and rejoined the team <TIMEX2 val="1999-SP" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the following
spring</TIMEX2>. But in <TIMEX2 val="1999-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May 1999</TIMEX2> a Tampa police officer arrested him on
charges of soliciting a prostitute and possessing drugs. He was
sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P1.5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year and a half of probation</TIMEX2>. Baseball suspended him
for <TIMEX2 val="P3M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-05" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">three months</TIMEX2>, but he returned in <TIMEX2 val="1999-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September 1999</TIMEX2> and played
through the World Series.
	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last February</TIMEX2>, he failed a drug test required by Major League
Baseball and Commissioner Bud Selig suspended him for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">the <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2>
season</TIMEX2>. In <TIMEX2 val="2000-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2>, his colon cancer returned and he underwent
surgery to remove a second tumor.
	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last month</TIMEX2>, Strawberry was arrested by an off-duty police
officer in Tampa after he blacked out and drove his car through a
street sign and into the rear of car stopped at a red light. He
later admitted that he had been under the influence of powerful
sleeping pills and painkillers he was taking as part of his cancer
treatment.
	   Strawberry could have been sent to jail for violating his
probation at <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that point</TIMEX2>, but Judge Florence Foster of the
Hillsborough County Court sentenced him instead to <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">two years of
house arrest</TIMEX2>, to be served at a drug treatment clinic. He was
prohibited from leaving the center without permission from his
probation officer, Shelley Tomlinson.
	   But on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday night</TIMEX2>, Strawberry slipped away from the clinic
without permission <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21T23" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">around 11 p.m</TIMEX2>., officials said. He did not come
back until <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22T03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">3 a.m.</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Later that day</TIMEX2>, he admitted to Tomlinson that he
had smoked cocaine with ``a woman named Christine'' and had taken
ten pills of Xanax, a tranquilizer prescribed by doctors for
anxiety, according to court papers.
	   Heralded early in his career as a potential hall of famer,
Strawberry never fulfilled the promise of <TIMEX2 val="1983" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">his first year as a
professional</TIMEX2> in <TIMEX2 val="1983" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1983</TIMEX2>, when he started for the New York Mets and was
named the National League Rookie of the Year. He has a career
batting average of .259, with 335 home runs, but his journey
through the major leagues has been hampered by many personal
problems, ranging from alcoholism and drug addiction to convictions
on criminal charges and tax evasion.
