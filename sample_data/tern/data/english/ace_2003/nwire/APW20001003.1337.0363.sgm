U.S. Firm to Retrieve Russian Sub
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ The Norwegian subsidiary of a U.S.
firm run until recently by Dick Cheney will help recover the remains
of the 118 seamen who died in the sinking of the Russian nuclear
submarine Kursk.

	   The contract for the retrieval operations was awarded Monday to
the Tananger, Norway branch of Halliburton Co., the Dallas-based oil
services firm.

	   Cheney was Halliburton's chief executive from 1995 until August,
when he resigned to become the GOP vice presidential nominee.

	   Representatives of the company's Tananger branch signed the
contract Monday with the Rubin military design bureau, which designed
the Kursk.

	   Igor Spassky, the head of Rubin, told a news conference in St.
Petersburg that the retrieval work would begin about Oct. 18.

	   He said it would be impossible to bring back all the remains,
since most of the compartments in the shattered submarine were
destroyed in the Aug. 12 disaster.

	   ``We expect that we'll be able to retrieve 20 to 30 percent of
the crew in this operation, which would be a very good result,''
Spassky said. ``The rest we will have to bury after we raise the sub
itself.''

	   Neither side would say how much the contract is worth, though
Rubin had reportedly offered $9 million to another Norwegian company,
Stolt Offshore, to take part in the operation. That deal fell
through.

	   Authorities still have not determined what caused the explosions
and sinking of the Kursk, which went down during military exercises.

	   Russian officials say the most likely scenario was a collision
with a foreign submarine. But the United States, which has
acknowledged that its submarines were monitoring the military
exercises, has denied that. American officials say the Kursk may have
gone down after a torpedo misfire.
