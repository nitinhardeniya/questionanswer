Freed U.S. Prisoner in Good Spirits

	   LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) _ U.S. businessman Edmond Pope, fresh
from being pardoned by Russia for a spying conviction he denies, was
in good spirits Friday after a restful first night in freedom at a
German hospital, a spokeswoman said.

	   Pope, 54, arrived at the U.S. military's Landstuhl Medical Center
within hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered him
released Thursday. He immediately underwent medical tests and
counseling, seeing a specialist for internal medicine and a
psychologist _ and then had a good night's sleep, hospital
spokeswoman Marie Shaw said.

	   ``He rested very well. He is in good spirits,'' she said. ``And
he's had a good breakfast.''

	   Pope had been sentenced to 20 years in jail last week, the first
alleged U.S. spy convicted by Russia in four decades, but Putin
pardoned him to help relations with the United States. Pope looked
tired when he arrived in Germany after 253 days in Moscow's
high-security Lefortovo prison.

	   The release came soon after George W. Bush accepted victory in
the U.S. presidential election, and some Russian experts speculated
the move was made in hopes of garnering the president-elect's favor.
Thursday was the first day Putin could have released Pope under
Russian law. A presidential pardons commission had recommended the
move following Pope's conviction.

	   A Putin spokesman told The Associated Press that the Russian
leader pardoned Pope on humanitarian grounds and to preserve good
relations with Washington. President Clinton welcomed the release.

	   Pope, who has suffered in the past from a rare form of bone
cancer and whose health deteriorated while in prison, was to undergo
a complete medical examination at Landstuhl, about 85 miles southwest
of Frankfurt. Doctors said he might spend 24 to 36 hours in Germany
before returning to Oregon, where his parents live.

	   One of Pope's first wishes Thursday was for a cup of black
coffee. Hospital officials said he appeared healthy and not
malnourished.

	   Pope has rejected Russian charges that he illegally obtained
plans for a top-secret Russian Navy torpedo, saying what he purchased
was not secret and that the technology had already been sold abroad.
Pope sent a letter to Putin asking for clemency on the eve of his
conviction, said his wife, Cheri.

	   Cheri Pope had headed to the prison Thursday morning only hoping
to visit her husband for the first time since the Dec. 6 verdict. She
had been denied visits on several previous attempts, said Jennifer
Bennett, spokeswoman for Pope's Pennsylvania Congressman, Rep. John
Peterson. Instead, Pope was let go, and he and his wife soon were on
a plane to Germany.

	   Pope's company, TechSource Marine Industries, is based in State
College, Pa.
