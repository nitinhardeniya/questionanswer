	   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) _ George Hackett, an Associated Press
newsman who chronicled Kentucky for nearly six decades, died Monday
following a brief illness. He was 82.

	   He had undergone abdominal surgery in early September.

	   Hackett started his career in 1944 as a Wirephoto operator and
later held several supervisory positions, including news editor. He
spent his entire career in his native Louisville and most recently
was Kentucky enterprise editor.

	   ``George Hackett arguably wrote more stories read by more people
than any other journalist in Kentucky,'' said Ed Staats, Louisville
bureau chief.

	   ``George trained a generation of young AP writers and editors,''
said David Hawpe, editorial director of The Courier-Journal in
Louisville and former AP employee. ``He was a gentle, kind,
thoughtful, funny human being. And a superb, spare writer.''

	   Walter Dear, former owner and publisher of The Gleaner at
Henderson, wrote in a 1997 column about Hackett's greatest scoop. It
came in the aftermath of the 1968 Kentucky Derby, when officials
disqualified apparent winner Dancer's Image.

	   ``A Churchill Downs public relations man gave me a piece of paper
saying that Dancer's Image had some forbidden medicine in his
system,'' Hackett told Dear. ``I got to the phone in a hurry and beat
the competition by 15 minutes.''

	   In 1981, Hackett was presented the Distinguished Service of
Journalism award by Western Kentucky University. He was inducted into
the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame at the University of Kentucky in
1988.

	   Survivors include his wife, Mickey, a watercolor painter.

	   There will be no funeral service.
