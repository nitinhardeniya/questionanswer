PEPSICO IS REPORTED CLOSE TO PURCHASING QUAKER OATS

	   Almost a month after rejecting PepsiCo's takeover offer as too
low, Quaker Oats Co. is now close to reaching the same deal, to be
acquired by PepsiCo for $13.7 billion, say executives close to the
negotiations.
	   The resumption of the talks follows a decision by Coca-Cola's
board last week to abandon its own $16 billion deal to buy Quaker
Oats and its prize growth brand, Gatorade. That deal was scuttled
at the 11th hour when a divided Coke board decided it would be
paying too much for Quaker, the maker of food products such as
Rice-A-Roni, Aunt Jemima and Cap'n Crunch.
	   The boards of Pepsi and Quaker Oats are expected to meet
separately over the weekend to decide whether to proceed with the
deal, the executives said. A takeover could be announced as early
as Monday, the executives added.
	   Because two sets of takeover negotiations have already fallen
apart, one executive said that the deal was not yet certain and
could collapse.
	   Neither Pepsi nor Quaker would comment.
	   According to the executives, PepsiCo has offered to pay Quaker
shareholders the same 2.3 PepsiCo shares _ or $104.65 a share _ it
offered before for every share of Quaker. That represents a premium
of 20 percent over Quaker's stock price, which closed Thursday at
$86.94, down 69 cents. Shares of PepsiCo rose 13 cents Thursday, to
$45.50.
	   Based on Thursday's stock price, the deal would be worth about
the same as Pepsi's original bid. If Pepsi and Quaker come to an
agreement, the deal would end a monthlong takeover drama that
included public and private machinations by PepsiCo and by Coke, as
well as by a third suitor, the Danone Group of France, for control
of Quaker.
	   For all three companies, Quaker represents a chance to own the
Gatorade sports drink brand, which has proven itself to be a growth
machine in an industry that has remained relatively stagnant,
especially the once-celebrated carbonated drink brands.
	   If the deal proceeds, PepsiCo would gain a commanding stake in
the noncarbonated beverage industry, a fast-growing frontier that
soft drink makers have traditionally been slow to explore but have
been forced to take seriously in recent years.
	   PepsiCo's return to the bargaining table with Quaker Oats had
been greatly anticipated by investors and analysts, especially
after Coke abandoned its deal and Danone publicly expressed its
interest in buying Quaker and then reversed its position the next
day.
	   PepsiCo would also be saddled with Quaker's food business, which
it would probably sell, the executives said, though certain brands
might be folded into PepsiCo's Frito-Lay snacks unit. Because the
deal would be structured as a pooling of interests, the executives
said, PepsiCo would not be able to sell any of the food businesses
for two years from the official completion of the transaction.
	   The acquisition could be considered a major blow to Coke because
it would make PepsiCo, the smaller of the two, a much more powerful
rival by adding $1.8 billion in sales to PepsiCo's balance sheet.
	   PepsiCo hopes to increase sales even more by using its extensive
worldwide bottling and distribution business to make Gatorade a
global brand. Nonetheless, some analysts have questioned whether
Gatorade will be as popular in Europe and Asia as it has been in
the United States, one of the reasons Coke backed away from buying
Quaker.
	   However, at $13.7 billion, most analysts agree that the price is
a fair one.
	   Securing Gatorade would round out Pepsi's lineup of some of the
best-performing noncarbonated brands. It already has the leading
position in the iced tea market with its Lipton Brisk, as well as
the dominant stance in the relatively new iced coffee segment with
its Starbucks Frapuccino line.
	   Even more significantly, its Aquafina brand of bottled water, a
category responsible for roughly half of all the growth in the
noncarbonated soft drink business, is the industry leader, squarely
edging out Coke's offering in the field, Dasani, which is in eighth
place.
	   ``Pepsi has already begun to move very aggressively in the
noncarbonated area,'' said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest,
an industry newsletter. ``The addition of Gatorade would be a huge
enhancement to that strategy.''
