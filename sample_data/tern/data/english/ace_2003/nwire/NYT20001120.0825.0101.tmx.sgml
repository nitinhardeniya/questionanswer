<TEXT>
	   From every political melodrama flows a language unto itself.
Witness Richard M. Nixon's ``I am not a crook'' and Bill Clinton's
``I did not have sex with that woman.'' The vocabulary is
reinvigorated, crisis by crisis, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">evoking a signal moment in the
nation's understanding of itself</TIMEX2>.
	   Without the backdrop of war or depression or scandal, this
presidential campaign was about small ideas, and the words that
will be remembered reflect that.
	   A sampling from the controlling verbal authority of Campaign
<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2> follows.
	   BIG TIME
	   Dick Cheney's affirmation when George W. Bush declared into an
open microphone that a reporter was a ``major-league
((expletive)).''
	   BLACKBERRY
	   The <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-20T08:26:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">latest</TIMEX2> in road-warrior technology, used by all the top Gore
staff, this belt-clipped palm-sized device is continuously
connected to the Internet and allows the user to send and receive
e-mail instantly.
	   BUTTERFLY BALLOTS
	   Winging its way across the American consciousness, this ballot
presents a two-option configuration that is confusing to some
voters. It was designed by Theresa LePore, the elections supervisor
in Palm Beach County, Fla.
	   CHAD
	   The most-discussed word of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the post-election era</TIMEX2>, it refers to
the minuscule residue of computer punch cards, at least those that
are fully punched out. Variants include dimpled chad (bulging but
not pierced), pregnant chad (attached by all four corners to a
ballot that is either bulging or pierced, hanging chad (attached by
a single corner), swinging-door chad (attached by two corners) and
tri chad (attached by three corners).
	   The word appeared during <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the early days of telegraphy and
computing</TIMEX2>, but its origin is murky. The most plausible guess: It
stems from the Scottish word for gravel, or riverbed stones.
	   LOCKBOX
	   This is where Vice President Al Gore said he would secure Social
Security, ``out of the hands of politicians.''
	   RATS
	   Like the word plumbers from <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the Watergate era</TIMEX2>, this common word
has taken on a new complexion since the <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2> campaign. The rodents
appeared subliminally in an otherwise forgettable Republican
television commercial aimed at Gore.
	   SNIPPY
	   When Gore called Bush for the second time on <TIMEX2 val="TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">election night</TIMEX2>, to
retract his concession, Bush was incredulous. Gore was reported to
have responded, ``You don't have to be snippy about it.''
