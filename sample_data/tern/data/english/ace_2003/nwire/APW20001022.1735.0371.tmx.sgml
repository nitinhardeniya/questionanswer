	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ With the seas around them increasingly
rough, Russian and Norwegian divers on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> pierced the inner hull
of the sunken Kursk nuclear submarine in a laborious, precarious bid
to recover the bodies of 118 sailors inside.

	   Winds above the Arctic site mounted throughout <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2> and were
expected to pick up <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">overnight</TIMEX2>, threatening to curtail the operation.

	   Working nonstop in teams since <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, the divers carved into the
outer hull <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>, the first step in the planned recovery
operation. The divers hope to cut seven holes through both hulls of
the submarine to retrieve bodies or body parts from their tomb in the
Barents Sea.

	   After some struggle <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">overnight</TIMEX2>, the divers sliced through the
sturdy rubber layer between the hulls, said Capt. Vladimir Navrotsky,
chief spokesman for the Russian Navy's northern fleet.

	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Later Sunday</TIMEX2>, they cut a four-inch hole in the steel of the inner
hull leading to compartment No. 8, in the rear of the submarine,
Navrotsky said. Throughout <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2> they gradually enlarged the hole a
few millimeters at a time.

	   Russian navy spokesman Vadim Serga said cutting into the two-inch
inner hull could be completed by <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>.

	   The divers also were dismantling and removing pipes, wires and
other equipment in the six-foot space between the hulls that could
tear diving suits.

	   The operation was focused outside the submarine's rear end, less
damaged than the front, which suffered explosions and hit the sea
floor first in the <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug. 12</TIMEX2> accident.

	   Top Russian military officials have warned that safety concerns _
including fears about the Kursk's two nuclear reactors, and threats
to divers from jagged metal debris inside the wreck _ might force the
Navy to call off the complex underwater work 330 feet below the
surface.

	   Radiation levels at the site, monitored by Norwegian experts,
were reported normal <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>.

	   Navrotsky said the weather was steadily getting worse, but that
the divers would continue working unless the winds reached light gale
force.

	   Russian officials have not determined what caused the accident
that destroyed the Kursk during naval exercises in which all 118
seamen on board died. Possible causes include an internal malfunction
or a collision with a Western submarine or World War II-era mine.
