	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ With only <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-25" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">hours to go before a winner is
declared in Florida's presidential election</TIMEX2>, teams of election
officials in two counties <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> frantically checked for dimples,
hanging chads and daylight in hundreds of ballots before the
deadline of <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26T17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">5 p.m. Sunday</TIMEX2>.
	   That <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> limit was set by the Florida Supreme Court on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>
for all counties to report their final results to Katherine Harris,
Florida's secretary of state, who plans to go before the cameras
shortly afterward to announce a winner.
	   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas retained an official lead of 930
votes <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-25TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday morning</TIMEX2>, but Vice President Al Gore had picked up
442 votes in an unofficial tally of hand-counted ballots. Though
Gore gained more votes by <TIMEX2 val="TXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the hour</TIMEX2> in Broward County, it remained
doubtful that he would be able to exceed Bush's lead. Palm Beach
County elections officials said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-25TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday morning</TIMEX2> that Bush had
actually had gained 13 votes. But Democrats said that when later
counts were included, Gore was up by 32 votes.
	   Vote counters pledged to work almost around the clock to examine
as many ballots as possible.
	   ``We're racing against the clock, but I feel we're going to make
it,'' said Carol Roberts, a member of the canvassing board in Palm
Beach County, where, according to an official count, 1,868 of 9,500
questionable ballots had been reviewed by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-25TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday morning</TIMEX2>. One
county official, though, said 6,000 ballots had actually been
reviewed.
	   But even as the hand-counted ballots piled up in Palm Beach and
Broward counties, it became increasingly clear as <TIMEX2 val="2000-W47" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the tumultuous
week</TIMEX2> ended that the certified results that Harris plans to announce
on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> will immediately be swept away in a tide of litigation to
be filed by both sides, from county courtrooms across Florida to
the chambers of the U.S. Supreme Court. No matter which candidate
is able to declare himself the president-elect on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday night</TIMEX2>,
lawyers for Gore plan to be in court <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-27TMO" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">first thing Monday morning</TIMEX2> to
formally contest the election in three counties.
	   ``I think that both sides probably will want to be sure that the
results in the counties they're contesting are heard in front of a
court, regardless of how the overall statewide votes are,'' said
David Boies, Gore's chief lawyer in Florida. ``I don't think either
side will withdraw their contests just because on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26T17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday at 5 p.m.</TIMEX2>
one side or the other is a few votes ahead.''
	   Republican lawyers, in fact, said they might well file contests
in several counties over disputed military absentee ballots, many
of which were discarded because they lacked postmarks, dates or
proper signatures. Bush's campaign had already asked Circuit Judge
L. Ralph Smith to reinstate some of the ballots in a court hearing
on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>.
	   Smith said in court that he was unlikely to reinstate the
ballots, but Republicans planned to present new evidence <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>
that the ballots should be reinstated.

	   And lawyers for both sides began work <TIMEX2 val="2000-W47-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this weekend</TIMEX2> on briefs
requested by the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> to hear
Bush's appeal from the Florida Supreme Court's ruling allowing
manual recounts to continue beyond the state's deadline for
certifying returns. The initial briefs have to be filed by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28T16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">4 p.m.
Tuesday</TIMEX2>, and the justices will hear oral arguments at <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01T10:00" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">10 a.m. on
Friday</TIMEX2>.
	   The expanding universe of litigation made it clear that the real
deadline in the case is <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 12</TIMEX2>, the date by which the states must
select their delegates to the Electoral College. The <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>
deadline will be useful for psychological reasons to the declared
winner, who may in the public mind be harder to dislodge after he
receives a certification from Harris and the state's Election
Canvassing Commission. But with so many hearings and briefs planned
for <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the coming week</TIMEX2>, the joy of declared victory may be short-lived
if the winner must struggle to avoid being unseated.
	   Florida, indeed, offers ample precedent for successful election
challenges that topple victors. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-25T13:31:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Most recently</TIMEX2>, in <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2>, an appeals
court unseated Xavier Suarez, who had been elected mayor of Miami,
after his challenger, Joe Carollo, contested the election on the
basis of fraudulent absentee ballots.
	   In the Bush-Gore case, the Gore camp will not be alleging fraud
but rather errors and legal violations in counting ballots. In
Miami-Dade County, the Democrats plan to sue because the elections
board there voted to stop their manual recount of ballots, a direct
result, according to the Gore campaign, of a heated demonstration
by Republican partisans in the elections office. In Nassau County,
the campaign will contest the decision to toss out a recounted
tally where Gore picked up 52 votes. And in Palm Beach County, the
challenge will center on the disputed design of the ``butterfly''
ballot, and the decision by the elections board not to count many
dimpled ballots as votes.
	   The Democrats have seized in particular on the demonstration
that they say caused the Miami-Dade board to stop its hand counts,
charging that it was an orchestrated effort by Republicans to
disrupt the count. Many of the demonstrators in Broward County said
they were <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-25T13:31:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> recount observers who were being put up in local
hotels and given meals by the Republican Party.
	   In this race, of course, it will not be possible for a state
court to unseat a president-elect directly, so the object of Gore's
contest will be the electors that the state Legislature must select
by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 12</TIMEX2>. The Legislature is dominated by Republicans, many of
whom have said they are so angry at Gore's legal challenges that
they would vote to choose electors pledged to Bush even if Gore
should be certified as the winner on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>.
	   But after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-24TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday
afternoon</TIMEX2>, the leaders of the Florida House and Senate chose a
somewhat less confrontational tack, announcing plans to join Bush's
side before the U.S. Supreme Court. The leaders, who are close to
Bush's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, accused the Florida court
of usurping their power to determine state election law.
	   State lawmakers will not discuss their precise strategy for
intervening in the Supreme Court case. On <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, the Legislature's
chief lawyer, Charles Fried, refused to even discuss the range of
possible options. But in introducing the Legislature's legal team
on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, Tom Feeney, speaker of the Florida House, did provide
one potential clue to the Legislature's legal outlook.
	   Aides of Feeney's distributed to reporters a Wall Street Journal
opinion article written on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 13</TIMEX2> by Einer Elhauge, a Harvard law
professor who has been retained by the Legislature.
	   The article appeared under the headline, ``Florida Voted by the
Book _ Gore is trying to go outside the law to find votes.'' In it,
Elhauge accused the Democrats of engaging in irresponsible
repetition of ``clearly frivolous'' claims of voting irregularities
as part of a ``destructive political campaign.''
	   Of perhaps greater significance, Elhauge offered a cautious
assessment of Bush's chances before the U.S. Supreme Court. ``The
course of this litigation,'' he wrote, ``is much harder to predict
since it does not turn on any clear rules but rather on the meaning
of such general constitutional principles as equal protection, the
right to vote, and due process.''
	   The Legislature also plans to set up a joint committee to
investigate the election, although it is unclear how broad the
committee's mandate will be. The members of the committee include
state Sen. Daniel Webster, a Republican who has spearheaded calls
for legislative intervention, and Johnnie Byrd, one of the
Republican co-chairmen, who is known as a low-key but powerful
presence.
	   ``I hope the committee will review the constitutional
obligations and options of the Florida Legislature,'' Feeney said.
``The undermining of the authority of the Legislature to select the
method of determining delegates, and the potential that no slate of
legitimate selections may be in place to represent Florida on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec.
18</TIMEX2>, makes this process desirable to meet our obligations.''
