Bank of America Beats Expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Bank of America Corp.'s net earnings dropped 15 percent in the
third quarter, hurt by higher interest rates and a hefty
restructuring charge, though it beat analysts' expectations.
Meanwhile Bank of New York met expectations, helped by increases in
fees for securities operations, foreign exchange and private-client
services.

	   Bank of America

	   For the three months ended Sept. 30, Bank of America earned $1.83
billion, or $1.10 per share. In the year-ago period, the Charlotte,
N.C.-based bank earned $2.2 billion, or $1.23 a share.

	   Bank officials pointed to higher interest rates as well as a $346
million restructuring charge and a $257 million drop in the value of
auto leases.

	   ``Bank of America in the third quarter faced the same headwind of
higher interest rates and a slowing economy as other banks,'' said
Hugh L. McColl Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.

	   In July, Bank of America said it planned to cut as many as 10,000
jobs as it changes its focus from growing through mergers to becoming
more profitable through use of technology and operating efficiency.

	   Excluding the charges, the bank had operating profits of $2.18
billion, or $1.31 a share, in this year's third quarter. Analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were expecting $1.29 per
share.

	   Shares of Bank of America fell $1.44 to $45.13 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.

	   The entire banking industry has faced a climate of higher
interest rates over the past year. The higher rates have made the
cost banks pay for their money increase faster than banks have been
able to increase their prices for loans or other assets, analysts
say.

	   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, net income was $6.13 billion,
or $3.66 per share, up from $5.98 billion, or $3.37 per share, a year
earlier.

	   With $671 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, Bank of America is
the nation's second-largest bank in terms of assets behind Citigroup.
It has branches in 21 states and the District of Columbia.

	   Bank of New York

	   Bank of New York said its net income totaled $363 million, or 49
cents a share, in the third quarter compared with $773 million, or
$1.02 a share, a year earlier. The third-quarter performance was in
line with estimates from analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial.

	   After adjustment for one-time items, including a $1.02 billion
gain from the sale of BNY Financial and a liquidity charge for the
sale of loans, net income in the third quarter of 1999 totaled $313
million, or 42 cents a share, the New York-based bank said.

	   ``This quarter's performance continues to reflect the fundamental
strength of our long-term strategy,'' chairman and chief executive
Thomas A. Renyi said in a statement accompanying the earnings.

	   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, the bank reported net income
of $1.06 billion, or $1.42 a share, compared with $1.41 billion, or
$1.84 a share, in the year-earlier period.

	   In early afternoon trading, the bank's shares were changing hands
at $53.56, up $2.44, on the NYSE.
