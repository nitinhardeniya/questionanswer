	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ Stormy seas prevented divers from
entering the nuclear submarine Kursk on Friday, a day after naval
officials revealed evidence that more than 20 seamen had survived the
initial explosions that sank the vessel.

	   Meanwhile, anger against the government for its slow and confused
response to the Aug. 12 disaster was revived after officials found an
emotional letter in the pocket of a dead crewman describing the
survivors' moments after the catastrophe.

	   ``The Kursk crew has been buried alive,'' Veronika Marchenko,
head of the anti-military association Mother's Right, said in a
statement issued Friday. ``The government was trying to solve all
possible problems, such as concealing the tragedy, protecting
military secrets, raising the plummeting popularity of the president,
paying off too-persistent relatives or hushing up honest journalists.
All except one: acting quickly to save the crew.''

	   ``We should think what to do to make the government value
citizens' lives more than oil, military secrets or its own
prestige.''

	   Winds of up to 56 mph and a force-six gale in the Barents Sea
kept divers away from the wreck Friday due to the danger of being
jerked about on their tethers, said Northern Fleet spokesman Capt.
Vladimir Navrotsky.

	   ``The weather is worsening, with a snowstorm raging around the
rescue site,'' he said.

	   On Wednesday, divers recovered four bodies from the Kursk's
eighth and ninth compartments. Officials found a note in the pocket
of a submariner identified as Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, which gave the
first firm indication that some of the sailors had remained alive for
at least several hours after the explosions that sank the submarine.

	   Fragments from Kolesnikov's message told a horrifying story of
the submariners' struggle for life, saying 23 survivors had gathered
in a compartment in the stern, hoping to get out through the escape
hatch.

	   Most of the Kursk's crew of 118 apparently died instantly in the
explosions that sent a giant fireball and shock wave ripping through
the first five compartments, or perished within minutes as water
roared into the submarine.

	   But the revelation that some died a slow and torturous death _ by
drowning, hypothermia or suffocation _ has brought back the horror
that gripped the nation in the days after the disaster. And once
again, it called into question whether the government could have
saved some of the crew if it had not balked for days at accepting
foreign aid.

	   After the Kursk sank, Russian submersibles were unable to latch
onto the hatch, and the cash-strapped navy didn't have deep-sea
divers who could enter the submarine. When Norwegian divers were
finally invited to perform the work, four days after the sinking,
they did it within hours.

	   The newspaper Segodnya said Kolesnikov's note was ``deadly for
the government.''

	   ``The authorities buried the Kursk too early, maybe even when it
was still alive,'' it said.

	   Kolesnikov's note gave no indication of whether any of the crew
had survived beyond a few hours. Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov
quickly ruled out Thursday that there was any chance to save any of
the crew.

	   Northern Fleet commander Adm. Vyacheslav Popov said Friday he
believed no seamen could have survived longer than one day.

	   ``The time of death can be established only by forensic
expertise,'' he said. ``As a submariner, I can only assume that the
crew died no later than Aug. 13, and most likely before midnight of
Aug. 12.''

	   The statement has puzzled some experts and drew suspicions that
the navy officials were withholding some information.

	   ``They could have died within 24 hours or they could have lasted
longer than that,'' said Clifford Beal, editor of Jane's Defense
Weekly in London. ``Unless Adm. Popov has more information than he is
giving out, I don't see how he could say that at this point.''

	   ``The level of disinformation on the part of the Northern Fleet
during the rescue operation makes me doubtful that we can trust even
the information they are giving out now,'' Beal said.

	   Popov said he had little hope the divers would be able to recover
all the bodies from the ninth compartment, which is littered with
equipment dislodged from stowage places by the explosions. He said it
took divers more than two hours to recover one body that had been
squeezed between two metal cases.

	   ``It's very difficult for the divers to move inside the ninth
compartment,'' he said. Nevertheless, he said the divers would try to
remove as many bodies as they could when the weather permits. The
Navy has previously said it would cancel the operation if it is too
risky for the divers.

	   Officials initially planned to hold a memorial ceremony Saturday
in Severomorsk, the headquarters of the Northern Fleet, but postponed
it because of the gale that prevented helicopters from bringing the
four bodies to the shore.
