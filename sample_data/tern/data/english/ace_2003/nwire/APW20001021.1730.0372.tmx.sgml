	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Despite authorities' focus on two suspects,
the investigation into <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>'s bombing of an American warship in
this port is still in its beginning stages, the U.S. ambassador to
Yemen said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>.

	   Ambassador Barbara Bodine said the cooperation from the Yemeni
side has been ``excellent.'' Yemen has detained some 60 people for
questioning in the <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 12</TIMEX2> bombing of the USS Cole.

	   Nonetheless, ``we are a long way from reaching a conclusion,''
Bodine said. ``There is a whole range of evidence and leads that will
be pursued fully.''

	   Officials believe two suicide bombers maneuvered a small boat
packed with explosives next to the Cole, which was refueling here,
and then detonated it, killing 17 U.S. sailors and injuring 39.
Authorities have been focusing on two men who rented an Aden
apartment where bomb-making material was later found.

	   Bodine said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> that the timing of the incident will play a
crucial role in the investigation. She did not elaborate further. The
bombing happened <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12TXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">an hour after the ship arrived at the port for
refueling</TIMEX2>.

	   Security has been beefed up citywide since the bombing, with
hundreds of armed soldiers and undercover agents patrolling Aden's
streets. On <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>, the Cole rested in calm waters near the port,
where undercover officers made their rounds. Half a dozen armed
military personnel in blue camouflage fatigues manned a bridge where
local fishermen had docked their small boats.

	   In another part of the city, Yemeni police stood guard in front
of the house where the suspected bombers stayed and left bomb-making
material. The iron gate in front of the house was padlocked.

	   At a news conference on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, FBI director Louis Freeh
complimented Yemeni authorities' work in the case and said his agency
has a ``junior'' role in the investigation. But the U.S. presence in
Aden is unmistakable. Several U.S. ships float in the harbor,
military helicopters hover overhead, and Marines patrol the city.

	   Poet Mohammad Noman al-Sharjani, 56, said Yemenis in general are
not happy with the United States because of what is seen as its
support of Israel. A crowd of 1 million demonstrated <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> in the
capital, San'a, protesting against Israel, the United States and Arab
leaders regarded as too soft on Israel.

	   Despite such sentiments, al-Sharjani said Aden residents don't
mind the U.S. presence in this case. Airport security guard Nabil
al-Nizali agreed.

	   ``They're doing their job and we're doing our job,'' he said.
``They had soldiers killed here and they need to investigate that.''
