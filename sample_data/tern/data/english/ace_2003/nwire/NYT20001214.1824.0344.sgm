	   MOSCOW _ Edmond Pope, an American businessman and retired naval
intelligence officer who had been convicted of espionage by a
Russian court and sentenced to 20 years in prison, was pardoned
Thursday by President Vladimir Putin and was immediately flown out
of Russia.
	   Putin said in his decree that he had granted the pardon because
of Pope's health problems and because he wanted to preserve good
relations with the United States.
	   Pope, 54, left Russia on a small chartered plane less than three
hours after a prison warden read him the decision, ending his eight
months of imprisonment.
	   The businessman, who was noticeably thinner and dressed in a
brown jacket and sweater, was shown on Russian television with a
faint smile as received the news.
	   Pope, who suffers from a rare form of bone cancer, flew to
Germany, where he was examined at Landstuhl Regional Medical
Center. From there he and his wife, Cheri, planned to continue to
Grants Pass, Ore., where his mother, Elizabeth Pope, is caring for
his ailing father.
	   ``I have mixed feelings,'' Pope said just after his release in
comments that were broadcast on television and translated into
Russian. ``I'm glad, but at the same time I'm sad that I may have
caused harm to the relations between our countries.''
	   The Clinton administration, which earlier had condemned the
Russian court's decision, applauded Putin for granting the pardon.
In a written statement, Clinton called Pope's imprisonment
unjustified.
	   It appeared from the manner in which the pardon was delivered _
by authorities in Moscow _ that Russia did not want Putin to
announce Pope's release while in Cuba, where he flew on Wednesday
night for a three-day official visit. They were apparently hesitant
to see the Russian president reaching out to the United States
while meeting with an old Cold War ally, Fidel Castro.
	   Pope, who had worked in part on projects related to the
development of naval weapons at the Pennsylvania State University
Applied Research Laboratory, was arrested in April for what Russian
prosecutors said was spying. Pope, who owns TechSource Marine
Industries in State College, Pa., and an associate were purchasing
technical reports about a special rocket-propelled torpedo from
Prof. Anatoly Babkin, the head of the rocket-engine department of
Bauman State Technical University in Moscow.
	   Pope had argued that the contract he signed with Babkin
stipulated that the reports would not contain any secret
information.
	   Pope's lawyer indicated Thursday in a telephone interview that
the report might have included some classified information, but
that Pope was not guilty of any crime because he was not aware he
was receiving classified material.
	   In the market free-for-all that ensued after the fall of the
Soviet Union, the definition of secret information blurred as laws
changed, impoverished scientists began seeking new sources of
income and the government tried to redefine the West.
	   That was complicated by layoffs in the American military,
especially of highly trained officers with expertise overseas. Many
of these people came to the countries they had studied with
business projects, according to E. Wayne Merry, senior associate at
the American Foreign Policy Council, in a letter he posted to a
Russia-oriented news list on the Internet.
	   After arriving in Germany Thursday, Pope, dressed in a hospital
gown, waved a small American flag from a balcony overlooking a
throng of reporters and television cameras. According to Russian
television reports Thursday night from Germany, doctors said they
expected that Pope would soon be ready to continue his flight to
the United States.
	   Clearly, the months of imprisonment took its toll on Pope, who
lost two teeth and about 25 pounds, news agencies quoted his wife
as saying. Later in his confinement, he was moved to a six-bunk
cell from a room for two prisoners. His lawyer said his roommates
were heavy smokers and on occasion pilfered his food and once even
took his medicine.
	   Pope's case has been a source contention between Russia and the
United States, which is still trying to define relations with
Putin, who was relatively unknown when he won Russia's presidential
election in March.

	   The pardon also coincided with George W. Bush's victory in the
American presidential election, and some here said Putin's action
would strike a positive note for future relations.
	   ``This is a present for the new president,'' said Vladimir
Lukin, a former Russian ambassador to the United States who now
serves in the Russian parliament. ``I don't know whether Pope is a
spy. I don't know the documents. But to pardon Pope in the current
circumstances is a gesture in the right direction.''
	   In Moscow Thursday, the mood was unsympathetic, occasionally
verging on hostile. In one call-in radio show, each question was
more skeptical than the next. A woman from Moscow asked why Pope
had traveled all the way to Russia on business if he was ill, while
a young man said he did not think the issue even warranted a
call-in show.
	   But this did not dampen Pope's mood. Above all, he was just glad
to be going home. Joking with a Russian television journalist after
receiving his pardon, he dismissed a comparison to a movie-star
spy.
	   ``I'm no James Bond,'' he said, laughing. ``I'm just a retired
naval officer.''
