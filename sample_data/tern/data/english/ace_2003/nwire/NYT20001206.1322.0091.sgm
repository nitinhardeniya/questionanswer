	   MOSCOW _ A Moscow court on Wednesday gave the maximum sentence
of 20 years at hard labor to Edmond Pope, a former U.S. naval
intelligence officer accused of trying to acquire technology for a
rocket-propelled torpedo.
	   The verdict was read by Judge Nina Barkova as Pope stood in a
steel cage, holding hands through the bars with his wife, Cheri. He
shook his head in disbelief as the judge read out her reasons for
handing down the maximum sentence.
	   Pope's attorney, Pavel Astakhov, denounced the verdict as unfair
and a throwback to the Stalinist era. He said he had seven days to
file an appeal.
	   He said he could not comment yet on whether President Vladimir
Putin would consider releasing Pope for health reasons and allow
him to return to the United States. Pope has a rare form of bone
cancer that has gone into remission, but his family believes he is
seriously ill from the effects of 246 days of confinement at
Lefortovo Prison.
	   Pope, a businessman, was arrested in April in the midst of a
transaction to acquire technological reports about Russia's
superfast Shkval torpedo, a rocket-propelled torpedo that travels
230 mph underwater.
	   The technology represented a significant advance in submarine
warfare. No similar weapon exists in Western navies, experts said.
	   The first intelligence about the torpedo and its use on
nuclear-powered submarines became public after the fall of the
Soviet Union. The torpedo was taken out of service after that, but
updated models have been tested in the last few years, and the
military competition apparently continues.
	   For Washington and Moscow, the Pope case has become an
uncomfortable throwback to a Cold War-era of spy rivalry at a time
when Russia and the United States profess that there is no longer
such competition.
	   The trial began on Oct. 18 under protest from the United States.
	   Astakhov introduced documents that he said showed that Pope and
a professor at Bauman State Technical University, Anatoly Babkin,
had been trading unclassified information about torpedo technology
when they were both arrested in April.
