	   NEW YORK _ When the clock strikes midnight on Sunday, Dec. 31,
the millennium will finally come to a close and a new one will
begin _ an event widely celebrated a year early, when people around
the world welcomed in 2000.
	   But the arrival of Jan. 1 will also have a specific meaning
within the history of Christianity, for the coming of the new year
will mark the 1,700th anniversary of the faith's establishment in
Armenia. Given that these days, Armenian communities can be found
worldwide, the celebration will not be confined to that small
nation, which occupies a politically challenging swath of the
southern Caucasus, with borders shared by Turkey, Azerbaijan and
Georgia.
	   ``This is an occasion for the Armenians to remember the past,
and, while remembering the past, create a vision for the future,''
said Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, head of the Diocese of the
Armenian Church in America, whose headquarters are in Manhattan.
``One thing is very obvious,'' he added in a recent telephone
interview, ``for 1,700 years, enlightened by the faith St. Gregory
brought to Armenia, we are able not only to survive, but also to
have revival.''
	   St. Gregory, whose full, historic title is St. Gregory the
Illuminator, was the early Christian missionary who endured a
prolonged period of brutal imprisonment and then emerged
sufficiently unshaken to convert the Armenian king in the year 301.
The king proclaimed Christianity the state religion. It is a date
Armenians can point to with great pride because it preceded by more
than a decade the conversion to Christianity of the Roman Emperor
Constantine, a crucial event in the establishment of the faith.
	   The issue of survival, as the archbishop noted, has been a
pressing one for Armenians throughout their history, especially in
the 20th century. During World War I, Armenians living in what was
then the Ottoman Empire _ now Turkey _suffered attacks and forced
removals from their villages, which they have remembered ever since
as genocide. Vast numbers of civilians died. After the war, for
more than seven decades, Armenia endured as a state within the
former Soviet Union, finally emerging as independent in 1991.
	   Recalling the events of World War I as they affected his own
family, Barsamian said that his grandmother, then a young woman
three months pregnant, became a widow when her husband was taken
away, along with other men from their area, never to be seen again.
``Can you imagine a young, newly wedded girl, having all the dreams
of the future, and then everything got dark?'' the archbishop
asked.
	   But when he was growing up, he added, ``I did not see any
bitterness in her. Just the contrary, there was faith, and in this
profound faith, there was this continuing life.''
	   ``This is what we are celebrating,'' he said. ``And there is
power there. And that power is the power of God through human
beings.''
	   The interview with Barsamian took place before he was to depart
for Armenia, accompanied by two college-age parishioners who would
represent the faithful in the United States. In Armenia, the three
of them will join other, similar delegations from dioceses around
the world, for a ceremony led by His Holiness Karekin II, the
supreme patriarch and catholicos of the Armenian Orthodox Church.
	   On Sunday, the catholicos will go to Khor Virab, where St.
Gregory was imprisoned, and light a torch at midnight. Then he will
travel in procession to Etchmiadzin, the center of the Armenian
church, for a ceremony in which he will light a lantern on an
altar, and that light will be shared with the delegations from
around the world, each of whom will have brought its own lantern.
After a civic ceremony in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, the
delegations will return to their respective countries, where a
second set of religious ceremonies will be held, in a symbolic act
of spreading St. Gregory's light _ the message of conversion and
faith _ throughout the Armenian diaspora.
	   In New York, it will take place at St. Vartan's Cathedral, on
Second Avenue, on Sunday, Jan. 6. ``There will be a special service
with young people from each of our parishes,'' Barsamian said. At
its conclusion, a lantern will be given to representatives from
each parish, a young man and a young woman, who will take them back
to their home churches. In those churches, the light will be
available to the families of parishioners who want to light their
own lanterns and take them home.
	   ``I hope and I pray that this whole celebration will create a
new era in the life of the Armenian people,'' the archbishop said.
