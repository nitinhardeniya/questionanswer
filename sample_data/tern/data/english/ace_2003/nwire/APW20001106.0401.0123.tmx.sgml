	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Eric Daze's goal late in the third period was the
game-winner as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the Anaheim Mighty Ducks
4-2 <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-05TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday night</TIMEX2>.

	   The Blackhawks posted consecutive victories for the first time
<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this season</TIMEX2>.

	   Steve Sullivan, who had two assists, added an empty-net goal with
<TIMEX2 val="PT36S" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">36 seconds</TIMEX2> left and had two assists. Michael Nylander and Tony Amonte
also scored for Chicago, which has won three of its last four games.

	   Daze's goal was his second of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2>. He had asked the
Blackhawks to trade him <TIMEX2 val="2000-W44" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a week ago</TIMEX2> and was a healthy scratch in
back-to-back games in Minnesota <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last Sunday</TIMEX2> and Boston <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>.

	   Teemu Selanne and Marty McInnis scored for Anaheim, which is
winless in its last four game (0-2-2).

	   Guy Hebert started in goal for Anaheim, but was replaced after
<TIMEX2 val="PT15M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">just 15 seconds</TIMEX2> by Dominic Roussel, who faced all 37 Chicago shots.

	   Blackhawks starter Jocelyn Thibault finished with 15 saves.

	   Nylander opened the scoring 1:51 in when he skated, unchecked,
from the right wing boards and across the slot.

	   Selanne tied it at 1 with 4:11 left in the first. After circling
the Chicago net, he lofted a backhander over Thibault's shoulder.

	   McInnis gave Anaheim a 2-1 lead at 4:40 of the second, sliding in
a backhander from the goal line during a pile up in the crease.

	   Amonte tie it <TIMEX2 val="PT2M" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">just over two minutes</TIMEX2> later when he one-timed a
power-play goal from 10 feet.

	   Daze's scored the game-winner from the left circle at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">5:43 of the
third</TIMEX2> after intercepting German Titov's weak clearing attempt.

Notes: Selanne has six goals and six assists in his last 12 games.
...Chicago's line of Nylander, Sullivan and Dean McAmmond has been
hot. Sullivan, has four goals and three assists in his last four
games. Nylander has three goals and two assists over the same span.
...<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-05TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday night</TIMEX2>'s crowd was announced as 13,360, but the 20,500-seat
United Center was barely half full.
