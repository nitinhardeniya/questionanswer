	   SAN FRANCISCO _ <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">A decade ago</TIMEX2>, when a Japanese company sought to
acquire a Silicon Valley operation making crucial equipment for
semiconductor manufacturing, the prospect was treated in this
country as a threat to national security.
	   Chip industry executives and politicians feared that the sale
would touch off a chain of events ending <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">an era of American
technological supremacy</TIMEX2>.
	   <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> those fears have all but vanished. And a growing number of
industry executives say the most important lesson is not the threat
of overseas competition, but the value of international
cooperation.
	   The reason is a practical one: it will require almost $1 billion
to develop the essential technology for the next generation of
chip-making equipment. And with fears of Japanese domination having
abated, the U.S. government is underwriting less of the underlying
research. So chip makers say continuing advances are <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> beyond the
grasp of Americans alone.
	   Indeed, an alliance of American, Dutch and German chip makers is
expected to reach a milestone in <TIMEX2 val="2001-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April</TIMEX2> when they switch on a
futuristic chip-making machine able to etch circuit lines no more
than several hundred atoms across in width. It is a commercial
engineering challenge _ and an international collaboration _ on a
scale rare if not unequaled in any other industry.
	   ``The semiconductor industry has been unique in pursuing this
form of global cooperation,'' said Ulrich Schumacher, president and
chief executive of the German participant, Infineon Technologies.
``It's because our costs are brutally high.''
	   The privately financed cooperative effort is being conducted in
national laboratories better known for their work on the American
nuclear arsenal. It harnesses optical technologies involving highly
reflective mirrors and high-powered laser light sources borrowed
from research done as part of the missile-defense program known as
``Star Wars.''
	   The resulting chip-fabrication plants _ which themselves will
cost $1 billion to $2 billion each _ will be able to produce chips
for a myriad of consumer applications, from PCs to cell phones,
that will be 100 times as fast as those in use <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, with 100
times the storage capacity.
	   While the burden of developing chip technologies has encouraged
a trend toward global cooperation, it has also led to the emergence
of new players in the race to build state-of-the-art computer
chips. In <TIMEX2 val="199" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the last decade</TIMEX2> the semiconductor industry has expanded
dramatically with aggressive new chip makers emerging in Taiwan,
Korea and Europe.
	   The globalization of the chip industry is accelerating in part
because other regions are adopting gadgets like cell phones and
wireless digital devices at a faster rate than the United States.
But the role of American chip makers in sharing and transferring
technology has also been a factor. IBM, for example, rather than
bear the cost of research and development on memory chips by
itself, entered into a joint venture with Infineon, and the
partnership was instrumental in helping make Infineon a world
leader in memory technology.
	   And though the result has indeed been a dilution of American
leadership in the chip industry, there has been almost no evidence
of the anxiety that shaped a national debate on industrial policy
in the United States <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a decade ago</TIMEX2>.
	   ``There was a concern in Washington that this had to be a
U.S.-only technology, and we've been working hard to explain to
them that this has to be an international technology,'' said
Charles Gwyn, program director of the American-European consortium
working on the next generation of chip making gear. ``It needs to
be accepted worldwide to be successful.''
	   In <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1999</TIMEX2> global sales of the semiconductor equipment industry
were $28.6 billion and worldwide chip sales reached $149 billion.
Growth rates for chip production and chip-equipment purchases in
Europe, Korea and Taiwan indicate that those regions are rapidly
catching Japan and the United States, particularly in the most
advanced memory chips _ widely used in the most popular consumer
products, from desktop PCs to digital music players _ and in
state-of-the-art factories.
	   <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Today</TIMEX2> three European chip makers _ Infineon, ST Microelectronics
and Philips _ are among the world's 10 leading chip makers.
Meanwhile, <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a decade after the Japanese had come to dominate the
memory chip sector and were threatening to overtake the United
States in microprocessors</TIMEX2>, they are <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> being outpaced, in part
because they have tried to go it alone rather than cooperate in
research and development, Schumacher said.
	   ``They thought it was about controlling the technology,'' he
said.
	   The shift toward collaboration can be seen most clearly here in
the San Francisco Bay Area, where the privately financed
international effort to design the next generation of chip making
gear is under way at three national laboratories, Lawrence
Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley and Sandia California. 
	   Infineon of Germany, ASM Lithography of the Netherlands and
three American chip makers _ Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and
Motorola _ are underwriting the initiative, which involves an
exotic new technology known as extreme ultraviolet lithography, or
EUV. The research is considered crucial to continuing advances in
the semiconductor industry beyond <TIMEX2 val="2004" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2004</TIMEX2>, when current technology is
expected to reach its limits in etching ever-smaller circuits on
silicon.
	   When Robert Noyce, co-inventor of the silicon chip, set out <TIMEX2 val="1960" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four
decades ago</TIMEX2> to build one of the first chip-making machines, he
drove to a photographic supply house in search of an inexpensive
used camera lens for his new machine.
	   In contrast, the new machines, called steppers, are custom-made
devices. They are based on a laser-generated light source at
wavelengths far shorter than those commonly used <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. And they
require engineering feats, like the ability to create a machine
that can send light through a vacuum _ and one that moves fast but
produces no vibration.
	   The consortium researchers acknowledge that they still have
thorny technical problems to solve. And IBM and Lucent Technologies
are pursuing an alternative direction, using ultra-short-wavelength
X-rays to etch the circuits, instead of light.
	   But the Semiconductor Industry Association points to EUV as the
more promising technology, and the confidence of the
California-based researchers has been growing in <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent months</TIMEX2>.
Their approach is expected to lead to a prototype machine by <TIMEX2 val="2001-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April</TIMEX2>.
If all goes well, such machines will be producing chips
commercially within <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">five years</TIMEX2>.
	   The company that figures to bring the technology to market is,
in fact, the Silicon Valley Group, the outfit that caused a furor
when it was coveted by Nikon of Japan <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a decade ago</TIMEX2>. At <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the time</TIMEX2> it
was the lithographic division of Perkin Elmer; IBM ultimately
stepped in to ensure that it stayed in American hands. But after
further changes in ownership, it was <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> sold to ASM.
	   At <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the same time</TIMEX2>, Japan is independently pursuing the EUV
technology in a government-financed consortium. Whichever team gets
there first, it appears likely that for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the first time</TIMEX2> there will
not be an independent American-owned maker of the most advanced
chip-making machines.
	   <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Today</TIMEX2> the new landscape is being hailed by many in the computer
industry as a major step toward a borderless world in which
economic and technical interdependence are the hallmark of a new
global economy.
	   ``I really think the world has changed for the better,'' said
Papkin Der Torosian, the chief executive of Silicon Valley Group.
	   But some American officials remain concerned that while
government-financed consortiums in Japan and Europe are continuing
to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new technology, U.S.
government funds for research in semiconductor manufacturing are
dwindling.
	   In <TIMEX2 val="199" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the early 1990s</TIMEX2>, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency was spending more than $300 million <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year</TIMEX2> on efforts to
develop new semiconductor capabilities, in part to ensure that the
Pentagon would not have to turn to foreign suppliers for its own
needs. That spending is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> $55 million <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year</TIMEX2>, and is scheduled to
be phased out by <TIMEX2 val="2005" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2005</TIMEX2>.
	   ``The United States programs in basic research are a lot smaller
than the Japanese or European efforts,'' said Gordon Moore, a
co-founder of Intel, the leading American maker of chips. ``But
people here are riding high and so there just isn't a great deal of
concern <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2>.''
	   There is another, more fundamental reason there has been no
political outcry about the new globalization of the chip field,
according to many industry executives.
	   The rapid internationalization of the industry has made it
possible for large and small American companies to take advantage
of the low and subsidized cost of capital in countries like Taiwan
and Korea.
	   ``The industry has become so integrated globally that what was a
major trade issue <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a decade ago</TIMEX2> is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">today</TIMEX2> scarcely a peep or a
murmur,'' said Kenneth Flamm, a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Pentagon official who is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T20:25:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>
a professor of international affairs at the University of Texas at
Austin.
