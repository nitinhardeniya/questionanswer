Japan, N.Korea Talk on Relations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Japan and North Korea discussed the sensitive
issue of Japanese restitution for its colonial past on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> when
the often-hostile countries opened their third round of talks <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
year</TIMEX2> on normalizing relations.

	   The talks, in China's capital, come as Japan appears to be
lagging behind other countries' diplomatic maneuverings in Northeast
Asia's main flash point.

	   Long isolated North Korea has in <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W44" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent weeks</TIMEX2> held high-level
meetings with the United States and moved to open ties with Britain,
Germany and Spain.

	   Meeting at Japan's embassy, Japanese chief negotiator Kojiro
Takano and his North Korean counterpart, Jong Thae Hwa, agreed that
the U.S.-North Korean talks and the historic summit with South Korea
in <TIMEX2 val="2000-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June</TIMEX2> created a favorable trend, a Japanese Foreign Ministry
official said.

	   But in a sign of the difficulties in forging diplomatic ties,
negotiators delved into tough issues <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> for the very first time
in <TIMEX2 val="P9Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">nine years of talks</TIMEX2>, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

	   ``We have only entered into the serious phase of real
negotiations,'' said the official.

	   The talks, scheduled to continue <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>, likely will yield only
an agreement to continue talking, he said.

	   Two previous rounds of talks <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2> sputtered over North
Korea's insistence on compensation for Japan's often brutal <TIMEX2 val="1910" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1910</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1945" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">45</TIMEX2>
occupation and Tokyo's demands for information on Japanese citizens
allegedly abducted to North Korea to train spies.

	   North Korea broke off talks on ties <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">eight years ago</TIMEX2> after angrily
rejecting Tokyo's demands to track down 10 Japanese citizens.
Negotiations resumed in <TIMEX2 val="2000-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April</TIMEX2>, but North Korea has continued to deny
abducting anyone.

	   The Japanese official refused to confirm whether the abduction
issue was raised <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, but he said negotiators opened an in-depth
discussion into Japan's colonial past and how Tokyo could compensate
property and other claims related to the occupation.

	   ``These are very tough issues,'' the official said.

	   While Japan has rejected direct demands for compensation, Tokyo
has expressed a willingness to extend economic aid, as it did upon
normalizing relations with South Korea in <TIMEX2 val="1965" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1965</TIMEX2>.

	   Since the last round of talks in <TIMEX2 val="2000-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2>, Japan has said it will
send half a million tons of rice over <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next two years</TIMEX2> to help ease
acute food shortages in the North.

	   North Korea's Jong reiterated Pyongyang's gratitude for the food
shipment, the Japanese official said.

	   With the North's economy near collapse, Japan's media have
speculated that offers of hefty aid packages may be enough to tempt
Pyongyang into overcoming any reluctance about signing a
normalization agreement.

	   Japanese negotiators also raised security concerns, in particular
North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the official said.

	   North Korea's launch of a three-stage rocket over northern Japan
<TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two years ago</TIMEX2> prompted Japan and the United States to research an
anti-missile defense shield for East Asia.

	   If the United States, South Korea and other countries succeed in
winning North Korean assurances about those programs, Tokyo and
Pyongyang will be freer to focus on issues unique to their troubled
ties, the official said.
