U.S. Spy Trial Resumes in Moscow

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The closed-door trial of accused U.S. spy Edmond
Pope resumed Saturday after doctors said he was well enough to
continue to be tried, but his lawyer said the medical examination had
been conducted improperly.

	   Pope had suffered bone cancer that was in remission when he came
to Moscow, but his family and attorney repeatedly have expressed
concern that it could have re-emerged since his April 3 arrest.

	   The court has denied several requests for Pope to be examined by
English-speaking doctors.

	   Pope suffered two bouts of back and joint pain this week, forcing
his trial to be suspended Friday.

	   The news agency Interfax cited a doctor at the Lefortovo prison,
where Pope is incarcerated, as saying that Pope was examined Friday
at the presidential medical clinic, one of Russia's top facilities,
and that there was no sign of the bone cancer returning.

	   Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, said the court had received no
documents about the medical examination and had not been informed of
where or how the examination had been conducted. He said that
violated judicial procedure.

	   Prison doctors previously diagnosed the cause of Pope's pain as
osteochondrosis, a form of arthritis, and rheumatic inflammation of
the back and hip joints, Astakhov said. But he claimed that they
lacked the equipment or expertise to make an accurate diagnosis.

	   Russia's Federal Security Service arrested Pope on suspicion of
trying to illegally buy plans for a secret high-speed torpedo used by
the Russian navy. Pope has pleaded innocent, and his supporters say
the plans were for 10-year-old technology that has already been sold
abroad.

	   Pope, 54, a retired U.S. Navy officer from State College, Pa.,
had worked for the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State
University. He later founded CERF Technologies International, a
company specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment.

	   During the closed-door trial on Saturday, the court received
written testimony from Valdimir Ivashkov, a professor at Moscow's
Bauman Technical College, saying documents given to Pope about the
torpedo contained only non-classified information.

	   Ivashkov was responsible for tests on the torpedo's engine,
Astakhov said.

	   Astakhov also was quoted by Russian media as saying that Pope's
request to vote in the U.S. presidential elections on Tuesday was
denied. Astakhov argued that Pope had a right to cast his vote at the
U.S. embassy, but Russian officials said nobody could be allowed to
leave Lefortovo on Tuesday because it is a Russian holiday.

	   Oleg Plotnikov, the state prosecutor, said in a newspaper
interview published Saturday that Pope was a career intelligence
officer who was attempting to purchase the manufacturing technology,
which is secret.

	   Plotnikov said, ``the fact that the U.S. Congress, Secretary of
State (Madeleine) Albright and (President) Clinton himself are giving
Pope so much attention makes one wonder whether the man is just the
owner of a company employing as few as three or four personnel.''

	   Astakhov said Pope has been barred from taking his medication.
Russian regulations bar outside supplies of medicines to inmates, and
prison officials refused to allow Pope's wife, Cheri, to give him his
American medicines when she visited him last week.

	   Pope's supporters say they have little hope of a fair trial or
acquittal.
