Jailed American Appeals to Putin

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. businessman Edmond Pope, convicted of
espionage in Russia, asked President Vladimir Putin to pardon him
Thursday, and a presidential commission was set to hear his request,
Putin's press service said.

	   Pope was convicted Wednesday and sentenced to 20 years in a
maximum-security prison by a court widely criticized as being biased.
The president's pardon commission is to consider Pope's appeal of the
verdict on Friday morning, the press service said.

	   Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, had earlier called on Putin to
release the businessman from Pennsylvania, and suggested Washington
push for his freedom.

	   Putin would have ``no choice'' but to pardon Pope if President
Clinton appealed for clemency, Astakhov said.

	   ``And in this case, the U.S. president has already repeatedly
made such a request. If it's formulated as a petition for clemency,
then the international practice, principles and the laws of
diplomacy, as you will, leave no choice for our political leaders,''
Astakhov told The Associated Press.

	   Pope's wife Cheri spent the day meeting with the U.S. ambassador
to Moscow, James Collins, and other embassy officials. She said that
her request to see her husband had been turned down, and that she had
not had a chance to discuss his next steps with him.

	   ``I don't really understand the Russian judicial system,'' Cheri
Pope said Thursday. ``I still don't know what the charges were.''

	   She said she had requested an English translation of the verdict
and was told that it would take three to six days to prepare.

	   Pope, a retired U.S. Navy officer, was convicted of illegally
obtaining classified blueprints of a high-speed underwater torpedo,
the Shkval. Ever since his April 3 arrest, he has insisted on his
innocence, saying that the plans were not secret because they had
already been sold abroad and were published in open sources.

	   Pope and his family maintain he should be freed because of poor
health. He has suffered from a rare form of bone cancer, which was in
remission when he traveled to Russia this year, but his family fears
it may have returned. Cheri Pope said her husband also suffers from
high blood pressure, and he had trouble talking and writing notes
during an hour-long meeting at the prison earlier this week.

	   She said her efforts to win her husband's freedom wouldn't stop.

	   ``Every day I try to talk to someone that I think can help,'' she
said.

	   But she has also concentrated on offering support to other
members of the Pope family.

	   ``Our family is devastated. Ed's Mom, I can't talk to her without
her crying, and we cry together. It's been very, very difficult,''
she said.

	   Pope is the first U.S. citizen to be convicted of espionage in
Russia since U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down in 1960. He
was exchanged for a Soviet spy convicted in the United States.

	   Pope, 54, of State College, Pa., is the founder of CERF
Technologies International, a company specializing in studying
foreign maritime equipment.
