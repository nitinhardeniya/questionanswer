	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The wife of a U.S. businessman being tried on
Russian espionage charges said <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> there was no hope for an
acquittal and pledged to carry on efforts to free her husband from a
Moscow jail.

	   Cheri Pope arrived in Moscow on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> to support her husband
Edmond through <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-04" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the last days of his trial</TIMEX2>. Pope is scheduled to
deliver his closing defense argument on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, and a verdict is
expected soon afterward.

	   ``I am bracing myself for him to be found guilty,'' Cheri Pope
said outside the Lefortovo Prison, where she was to be allowed a
rare, <TIMEX2 val="PT1H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-05" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="possibly within 2000-12-04">hourlong</TIMEX2> visit with her husband.

	   ``I'm going to have to sit there and listen to my husband be
sentenced to the maximum penalty and proceed from there. I'm not
going to give up and I'm not going to go away,'' she said.

	   It was only her fourth visit with Pope since he was arrested in
<TIMEX2 val="2000-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April</TIMEX2> and imprisoned on charges of obtaining classified blueprints
for a high-speed torpedo. The trial judge turned down Cheri Pope's
request to see her husband again on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, the latest in a string
of rejections, but she will be allowed to attend the reading of the
verdict.

	   ``<TIMEX2 val="PT1H" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">One hour <TIMEX2 val="P2M" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every two months</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> is not enough,'' protested Rep. John
Peterson of Pennsylvania, who accompanied Cheri Pope to Moscow. ``He
is shut off from his family and the whole world. ... His life stopped
<TIMEX2 val="2000-04-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="this is assuming he said this on December 5, 2000">245 days ago</TIMEX2>.''

	   Prosecutors in the closed-door trial have demanded the maximum
sentence of <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">20 years in prison</TIMEX2>, and payment of a staggering $250
million for damages to Russia's defense industry.

	   Pope's family and defense lawyers have accused the judge of bias,
and they have expressed only pessimism about the trial's possible
outcome.

	   The defense contends that the torpedo blueprints had already been
sold abroad and published in open sources. And Pope's main accuser
has recanted his testimony.

	   Washington has urged Russia to release Pope, partly because he is
in poor health. Pope has suffered from bone cancer, which was in
remission when he came to Moscow but which his family fears may have
returned.

	   Cheri Pope said after seeing her husband <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> that she was
shocked at his condition.

	   He is ``a sick man and he needs medical care <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>. Not <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a week from
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, not <TIMEX2 val="2001-01-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a month from <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>,'' she said.

	   During the <TIMEX2 val="P7W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W49" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">seven-week</TIMEX2> trial, Pope has suffered from attacks of
sharp pain, and he has been permitted to sit during the hearings
rather than standing as prisoners usually do. However, the judge has
turned down repeated defense requests for an independent medical
evaluation by English-speaking doctors.

	   Pope, 54, is a retired U.S. Navy officer and founder of CERF
Technologies International, a company specializing in studying
foreign maritime equipment.
