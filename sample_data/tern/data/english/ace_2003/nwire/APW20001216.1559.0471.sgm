Cohen Visits Troops Off Italy Coast

	   ABOARD THE USS TRUMAN (AP) _ American officials are on guard
against possible terrorist attacks during the holiday season, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Saturday.

	   Cohen was aboard the aircraft carrier USS Truman off the Italian
coast, the first stop of a four-day trip to visit U.S. troops in
Italy and the Balkans.

	   ``We're trying to anticipate whether or not there will be any
action that might coincide with the end of Ramadan and the beginning
of our Christmas holidays,'' the outgoing defense secretary said.
``It is a period that we watch very closely.''

	   Earlier this month, Cohen authorized the deployment of extra Navy
and Coast Guard personnel in the Persian Gulf, stepping up security
in the aftermath of the Oct. 12 terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in
Yemen that killed 17 sailors.

	   Cohen also said that the transformation of the U.S. military into
a ``more rapidly deployable, lighter and more sustainable'' force is
``irreversible,'' and that the new administration led by
President-elect George W. Bush will have to follow the same path.

	   ``These initiatives are essential if we're going to transform the
force that we had in the 20th century into one of the 21st century,''
Cohen said. ``I don't see any prospects of them fading away.''

	   Cohen said such a force would be better equipped against the
challenges the United States and Europe will confront in the upcoming
years, such as transnational terrorism, the use of chemical and
biological weapons and political instability.

	   Cohen was on his fourth and last tour of U.S. troops abroad.

	   ``It is the most exhausting job one could possibly ever have,''
he said of his tenure as defense secretary, addressing hundreds of
soldiers in the ship's hangar. ``It's also the most rewarding.''

	   Accompanying Cohen on his visit to the carrier was his wife,
Janet, and a lineup of celebrities that include football
Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw and the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.

	   The Truman is a new, nuclear-powered vessel on its first
deployment. It carries a crew of 5,000.
