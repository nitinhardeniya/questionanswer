Clinton to Putin: Release American
</HEADLINE>

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A government commission testified in an espionage
trial <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> that torpedo design plans obtained by an American
businessman were classified _ as prosecutors allege.

	   The testimony in Edmond Pope's trial came as President Clinton
asked Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting in Brunei to
release Pope on humanitarian grounds. Pope has bone cancer which is
in remission, but his family says it is flaring up again, and the
court has repeatedly refused his requests to see an English-speaking
doctor.

	   Pope is being tried in a closed court on charges he sought to
obtain classified plans for a high-tech Russian submarine torpedo.
Pope denies the charges, saying the information had already been sold
abroad and wasn't secret.

	   But Georgy Logvinovich, a member of the expert commission, said
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, ``We again concluded that the materials were secret and
had the most direct link to all programs for developing the Shkval''
torpedo, according to the Interfax news agency.

	   Commission member Yuri Fadeyev added, ``They were never
declassified and we don't plan to declassify them.''

	   When Pope initially requested the materials, another group of
experts determined that the materials were not secret.

	   But then the government commission was formed to review the case,
and concluded that the plans, parts of which Pope received before his
arrest, were in fact classified. The commission confirmed that
finding in its testimony <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, according to Russian news
reports.

	   Defense lawyer Pavel Astakhov said the government commission
experts are biased because they have worked closely with the material
in question.

	   The U.S. government has urged Pope's release, saying the
authorities have failed to show Pope did anything illegal. One of his
key accusers has recanted a statement that implicated him in
espionage.

	   A U.S. consular official was allowed to have a rare meeting with
Pope in Moscow's Lefortovo prison on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>. Interfax said they
discussed Pope's health and prison conditions. U.S. officials gave no
details of the meeting.

	   Pope, 54, of State College, Pa., is a retired U.S. Navy officer
who founded CERF Technologies International, a company specializing
in studying foreign maritime equipment.
