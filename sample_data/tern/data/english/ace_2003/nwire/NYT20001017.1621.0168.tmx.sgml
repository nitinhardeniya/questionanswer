	   NEW YORK _ When chefs get their hands on classic comfort foods,
they often wind up with macaroni and cheese enriched with half a
dozen European cheeses, or meatloaf with foie gras. The high style
obliterates the simple pleasure.
	   For me, nothing says comfort quite like bar food _ casual,
classic things like Buffalo wings. But there is no way my
restaurant could serve deep-fried chicken wings tossed with hot
sauce, accompanied by blue cheese dip and celery sticks. And I
didn't want to dress them up beyond recognition.
	   My solution replaces the chicken wings with boneless quail and
the hot sauce with an Asian-inspired ginger glaze.
	   I buy the quail butterflied, with the breast and thigh bones
removed; only tiny leg and wing bones remain. Most butchers sell
the birds that way, and I just cut them in half lengthwise to make
them easier to eat and quick to cook. We deep-fry the quail, but at
home they can be pan-fried. Just <TIMEX2 val="PT2M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two minutes in hot oil</TIMEX2> crisps the
skin and leaves the meat perfect: Rosy at the bone. Don't cook them
more or the meat will taste livery.
	   As soon as the quail come out of the hot oil, I lacquer them
with an incredibly simple glaze made with pineapple juice, dried
chilies, brown sugar and fresh ginger. The pineapple and brown
sugar give it great body and sweet stickiness, while the sliced
ginger and chilies provide heat and punch. I use dried Thai bird
chilies, which are quite spicy, but any small dried chilies are
fine. With the ginger, more is definitely better here. In the
restaurant, we use 10 pounds of ginger <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day</TIMEX2>. The skin has a lot of
flavor, so simply slice the unpeeled ginger into thin coins, which,
along with the chilies, are strained out when the glaze has reduced
sufficiently.
	   I serve the lacquered quail on a bed of greens with thick rings
of pineapple that have been flavored with vanilla, brandy and honey
and roasted in a hot oven until tender. I usually sprinkle the
platter with chopped toasted macadamia nuts and sliced fresh water
chestnuts or julienned jicama.
	   At home, I serve the lacquered quail alone, to be eaten with
fingers. Lacquered quail are too messy for a fancy cocktail party
but are ideal for a casual event, like a gathering to watch
football on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-7" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a Sunday afternoon</TIMEX2>. If you make the glaze before the
game, you can actually fry and lacquer the quail during a
commercial break.
	   GINGER-LACQUERED QUAIL
	   <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Time</TIMEX2>: <TIMEX2 val="PT1H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1 hour</TIMEX2>
	   2 cups pineapple juice
	   2 small dried chilies, like Thai bird chilies
	   \ cup light brown sugar
	   1 2-inch piece unpeeled ginger, sliced thin
	   4 partially boned, butterflied quail
	   Canola oil for frying
	   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
	   All-purpose flour for dredging
	   1. Combine pineapple juice, chilies, brown sugar and ginger in
medium skillet, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and cook at bare
simmer until liquid reduces to about 1/3 cup, <TIMEX2 val="PT30M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">30</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="PT40M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">40 minutes</TIMEX2>.
(Mixture will darken and thicken considerably.) Strain into clean
bowl. (It can be refrigerated for <TIMEX2 val="P1W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a week</TIMEX2>. Bring to room temperature
before using.)
	   2. Cut each quail in half from neck to tail. Place half the
glaze in medium bowl, and set aside.
	   3. Heat about \ inch oil in large skillet until shimmering.
Season quail generously with salt and pepper to taste, then lightly
dredge in flour and shake off excess.
	   4. Add 4 quail halves to hot oil, and fry, turning once, until
well browned, <TIMEX2 val="PT2M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="PT3M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">3 minutes</TIMEX2>. Transfer to glaze, and toss with
tongs to coat. Transfer glazed quail to platter. Pour remaining
glaze in bowl. Repeat with remaining quail. Serve immediately.
	   Yield: 4 appetizer portions.
