PepsiCo Resumes Talks With Quaker
</HEADLINE>

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ PepsiCo Inc. has resumed talks to buy Quaker Oats
Co., the maker of Gatorade and Cap'n Crunch cereal, for about $14
billion in stock, a source familiar with the discussions said
Thursday.

	   The offer being considered mirrors the one Chicago-based Quaker
rejected in early November, according to the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. In the interim, Quaker discussed selling
itself to Coca-Cola Co. but the Atlanta beverage maker's board
abandoned those talks.

	   Both PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., and Quaker Oats declined
to comment on Thursday.

	   Gaining control of Gatorade would give PepsiCo the dominant brand
in the sports drink category, which has been growing faster than
colas.

	   The source said PepsiCo is offering 2.3 of its shares for each
Quaker share, the same deal offered to and rejected by Quaker a month
ago. The source said the offer contains no price protection provision
for Quaker shareholders in case PepsiCo's share price should fall
before the deal is completed.

	   While the companies hope to wrap up these talks quickly, the
source cautioned that there was no guarantee there would be a deal.

	   The Wall Street Journal, which reported earlier Thursday on its
Web site that the talks had resumed, said the companies were close to
agreement on all major points, that final board meetings were
expected this weekend and an announcement could follow on Monday.

	   Based on PepsiCo's closing price Thursday of $45.375, the deal
would value shares of Quaker Oats at $104.36. At the end of regular
trading on Thursday, shares of Quaker Oats were at $86.938, down 93.8
cents.

	   Last week, Coca-Cola abandoned its pursuit of Quaker Oats after
the soft drink company's board rejected a deal reportedly worth
$15.75 billion.

	   Only hours after Coca Cola's announcement, the French food
conglomerate Danone SA issued a statement that it may be interested
in making a bid for Quaker Oats. But it also dropped out of the
running.

	   Gatorade began in the 1960s as a drink for thirsty athletes but
has become a mainstream beverage. It commands more than 83 percent of
the U.S. retail market for sports drinks. Coke's Powerade and
PepsiCo's All Sport are distant rivals.

	   PepsiCo's Pepsi-Cola division is the nation's second biggest soft
drink concern with brands like Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola is the soft drink leader.

	   PepsiCo has been moving to expand its non-carbonated drink
portfolio, which currently includes Aquafina water, Lipton teas and
Tropicana juices. It recently agreed to buy South Beach Beverage Co.,
which makes herbally-enhanced juices and teas.

	   Quaker has a large food business that includes such brands as
Quaker and Cap'n Crunch cereals, Aunt Jemima mixes and syrup and
Rice-A-Roni.

	   PepsiCo's Frito-Lay division is the nation's leader in salty
snacks with brands such as Lay's, Fritos and Doritos chips.
