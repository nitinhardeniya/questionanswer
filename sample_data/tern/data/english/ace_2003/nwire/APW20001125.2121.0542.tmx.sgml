Top Court To Focus on Untested Law

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Supreme Court usually ponders the
legal ramifications of events long passed, and the justices are
generally unimpressed by partisan political maneuvering.

	   In the extraordinary decision to consider what might most
appropriately be called Bush v. Gore, the court is jumping into the
middle of fast-moving current events and a maelstrom of political
spin.

	   ``They are all lawyers, and as a lawyer it would have been very
hard for them to resist the opportunity to deal with a question as
momentous and yet as unusual as this,'' New York University law
professor Stephen Gillers said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>. ``It is a constitutional
question that comes along once in <TIMEX2 val="P1CE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a century</TIMEX2>.''

	   The justices _ or at least the four it takes to accept a case _
agreed to look at two of three complaints raised by Republican George
W. Bush in the wake of a Florida Supreme Court ruling allowing late
manual recounts of presidential ballots in several Democratic-leaning
counties.

	   Democrat Al Gore sought the recounts in hopes of overtaking
Bush's slim lead in the state that will decide the next White House
occupant.

	   At issue is whether the Florida court violated the Constitution
and a little-known and apparently untested federal law.

	   The gist of the Bush claim is that the Florida Supreme Court
overstepped its bounds and made law, instead of reviewing it, when it
allowed hand recounts to continue through <TIMEX2 val="2000-W47-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the weekend</TIMEX2>, and dictated
that those recounts figure in the final statewide tally <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-25T21:40:07" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> due
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>. The Republicans say the rules were changed part-way through
the game.

	   Gore claims the Florida court was merely doing its job in
resolving conflicting directions from the Florida legislature about
how to deal with close elections.

	   The constitutional question centers on the document's guarantee
that states get to decide for themselves how to choose electors to
the Electoral College.

	   The question of federal law, or what lawyers call the statutory
question, deals with an <TIMEX2 val="1887" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1887</TIMEX2> law that says states' electors must be
chosen under laws already on the books before <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Election Day</TIMEX2>.

	   Gillers and other constitutional scholars said they can find no
references to the law in subsequent court cases _ meaning it likely
has never been challenged.

	   Many constitutional scholars were startled by the court's
willingness to take the case, but predict that having done so the
justices will strive for unanimity.

	   In <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent years</TIMEX2>, the justices have issued a series of 5-4
decisions that have boosted states' power versus that of the federal
government.

	   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a conservative nominated to the
court by Richard Nixon, has led many of those decisions. Some
Democrats are eyeing him now in much the same way that Republicans
regarded the Democratic-dominated Florida Supreme Court <TIMEX2 val="2000-W46" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>.

	   If the court rules for Bush, and especially if the decision comes
from the court's conservative wing, that will open the door to
charges that the justices were influenced by politics, Gillers said.

	   ``There are people prepared to believe that, but I hope Gore does
not do that,'' Gillers said. ``I think it's very important for either
side, even if it loses, to accept the legitimacy of the decision.''

	   The court agreed to what, for it, is a rapid-fire schedule; legal
briefs that lawyers ordinarily polish for <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">months</TIMEX2> are due <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>,
responses are due <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> and oral arguments are set for <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>.

	   But as the court seemed to acknowledge <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, even its fastest
consideration may not be fast enough to catch up with the Florida
presidential election. The state's chief election official has said
she intends to certify a winner on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday night</TIMEX2> _ <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">five days before
the justices hear the case</TIMEX2> _ barring <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last minute</TIMEX2> legal maneuverings.

	   On its own, the court asked both sides to address the
consequences of overruling the Florida court.

	   ``Put another way, the court is asking, 'even if you're right,
what do you want us to do about it?''' said David Boies, who is
leading Al Gore's legal team in Florida.

	   The presidential election has been in limbo <TIMEX2 val="P3W" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W47" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">nearly three weeks</TIMEX2> as
Republicans and Democrats scrap over recounts that Gore hopes will
tip the contest to him. Bush holds an official lead of 930 votes in
Florida.
