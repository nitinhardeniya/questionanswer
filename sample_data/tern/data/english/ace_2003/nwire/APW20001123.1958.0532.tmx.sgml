Kursk Collision Theory Questioned

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Retired navy officers on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> objected to
suggestions that the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk sank because it
collided with another vessel, saying that such a crash would not have
caused catastrophic damage.

	   ``There could have been a collision, but it wouldn't have led to
such tragic consequences,'' retired Adm. Eduard Baltin said at a
conference organized by the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. He said a
crash probably would have dented the submarine's outer hull but would
not have crippled it.

	   The Kursk, ripped apart by a pair of massive explosions, sank to
the bottom of the Barents Sea, killing all 118 men aboard. Russian
officials _ including Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov _ have said
a collision was the most likely cause of the <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug. 12</TIMEX2> sinking.

	   But Baltin and other <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T20:51:32" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> navy officers recalled numerous
collisions between Russian and Western submarines stalking each other
during the Cold War. The vessels always lumbered back to base and
were back in service after minor repairs, the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T20:51:32" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> officers said.

	   A government commission hasn't determined the cause of the
disaster. Some experts have suggested a torpedo exploded in the
ship's weapons bay. Others have said the explosion could have been
caused by a <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">World War II-era</TIMEX2> mine or an internal malfunction. But
government officials have repeatedly said they believe a collision
was the mostly likely explanation.

	   Northern Fleet chief Adm. Vyacheslav Popov said <TIMEX2 val="2000-W47" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> that a
foreign vessel emitted SOS signals in the sinking area shortly after
the disaster. The Russian Navy has searched the seabed for debris
that could have been left by a collision but has not reported finding
any.

	   The United States and Great Britain operate submarines in the
Barents Sea and had vessels monitoring the Russian naval exercises
when the Kursk sank, but both countries have denied their boats were
involved in the accident.

	   The retired submariners also dismissed the mine theory, saying
such World War II ordnance would have caused only light damage to the
state-of-the-art vessel.

	   The officers said a fire in the torpedo compartment was a
possibility but insisted it would not have triggered an explosion.
They said the disaster was likely caused by a combination of several
external and internal factors, but they wouldn't describe them,
saying the information is classified and they fear arrest by the
Federal Security Service.

	   Some media reports have suggested that the Kursk was testing a
new torpedo system that uses a liquid fuel propulsion system, which
some sailors consider unstable. That could have exploded
spontaneously, but Klebanov has denied the submarine had such weapons
aboard.
