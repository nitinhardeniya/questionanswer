Russia Spy Trial Stops for Holiday

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ American businessman Edmond Pope got a brief break
from his Moscow espionage trial <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> when the judge cut short
hearings so that he could observe <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thanksgiving</TIMEX2>.

	   Pope, accused of seeking classified plans for a high-speed
torpedo, spent <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-23TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the morning</TIMEX2> in the suspects' cage in a Moscow
courtroom, as he has throughout the <TIMEX2 val="P1M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthlong</TIMEX2>, closed-door trial.

	   ``He wasn't in a <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">holiday</TIMEX2> mood,'' defense attorney Pavel Astakhov
said.

	   After he returned to Lefortovo prison in <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-23TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the afternoon</TIMEX2>, a U.S.
consular officer was to bring him some turkey, Astakhov said.

	   But the officer was refused access to Pope, a U.S. Embassy
official said. Consular officials have been allowed to meet with Pope
only on a few occasions since his <TIMEX2 val="2000-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April</TIMEX2> arrest.

	   The defense marked a small victory <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-23TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday morning</TIMEX2> when Judge
Nina Barkina threw out one volume of documents of the eight-volume
indictment. Astakhov said the documents were related to witnesses who
have not been called to testify in court.

	   Barkina has turned down most of the defense's motions, and a
defense effort to have her removed from the case <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> was
rejected.

	   Among the witnesses whose testimony was thrown out was U.S.
researcher Daniel H. Kiely, who was arrested along with Pope. Kiely,
head of energy and power systems at Pennsylvania State University's
Applied Research Laboratory, was released after being questioned by
Russian authorities and says he knows nothing about the alleged
purchase of secret data.

	   Pope's supporters say the plans he was seeking were already sold
abroad and weren't classified. One of Pope's key accusers has
recanted a statement that implicated him in espionage.

	   But a government commission concluded that the plans, parts of
which Pope received before his arrest, were in fact classified.

	   Pope, 54, of State College, Pa., is a retired U.S. Navy officer
and founder of CERF Technologies International, a company
specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment.

	   The U.S. government has urged Russia to release Pope, saying
Russian authorities have failed to show he did anything illegal, and
because of his health. His family fears that Pope's bone cancer,
which was in remission when he came to Moscow, may have returned.
