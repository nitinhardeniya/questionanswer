	   WASHINGTON _ New York state will probably lose two seats in the
U.S. House of Representatives. California may gain one, though
state officials are hoping for two. Montana could go either way.
	   On Thursday, the Census Bureau will publish the official
population count for the United States, including the
state-by-state totals required under the Constitution to determine
how many seats each state is allocated in the House. The figures,
eagerly awaited by many state government officials, are the first
in a wave of releases of demographic data based on the 2000 census.
	   ``This is really the primary reason the census is conducted,''
said Martha Farnsworth Riche, a former director of the Census
Bureau, ``and the reason is to force the nation's political system
to constantly adjust for shifts in the distribution of population.
We know from history that people in power won't do that if they
don't have to.''
	   Census officials have been tight-lipped about what the total
population and state-by-state counts will show. ``I've purposely
not wanted to know the figures in advance in case I had a weak
moment and told somebody,'' said Kenneth W. Prewitt, the director
of the Census Bureau.
	   Population estimates issued periodically by the Census Bureau
indicate that as of October, 275,843,000 people were living in the
United States, an increase of nearly 11 percent, or put another
way, an increase of more than 27 million people, since 1990.
	   Under federal law, each state will be allocated a seat in the
House for an average of each 625,000 people counted by the census.
The Constitution mandates that each state receive at least one seat
in the House. Additional seats are then assigned to each state
based on a person-to-House-member ratio that changes every 10 years
because the country's population keeps growing and the number of
seats in the House remains at 435.
	   According to experts who study demographic and political trends,
California, Colorado, Florida and Nevada probably will add a member
to their congressional delegations. Arizona, Georgia and Texas each
may add two. On the other side of the ledger, these experts predict
Connecticut, Illinois, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Wisconsin
will each lose a congressional seat, while New York and
Pennsylvania will probably drop two. New Jersey is expected to
remain the same.
	   Not wanting to sound too downcast in advance of knowing how his
state will fare, Sheldon Silver, the Demo- cratic speaker of the
New York state As- sembly, declined to speculate on the impact of
losing House seats. ``It's all premature since the data has to be
analyzed,'' Silver said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ``We have
to see where and how, accord- ing to the United States Constitution
and the state constitution, how we can have the state best
represent- ed.''
	   For Montana, which lost one of its two seats after the 1990
census, it is a close call as to whether the state will get that
seat back.
	   As of the last state-by-state estimate made about a year ago,
Montana had a large enough population to regain its second seat _
but with only 934 people to spare.
	   ``Montana is just so darn close,'' said Kimball W. Brace,
president of Election Data Services, a Washington company that
tracks demographic and election trends.
	   The data that will be released this week will not be the subject
of court challenges. In January 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that
population counts that are statistically adjusted to compensate for
overcounts and undercounts could not be used to allocate seats in
the House.
	   The high court left open the possibility of using adjusted
population counts down to the city-block level for redistricting,
which is the drawing of boundaries for House and other legislative
districts.
	   Still, for a number of states, the state-by-state totals will
confirm a gain or a loss in political power in Washington.
	   ``If you're going from six to seven seats or five to six, it's a
big deal because your representation is going up by a much larger
fraction,'' said Tim Storey, a redistricting expert at the National
Council of State Legislatures. ``But even in those larger states,
gaining a new seat is a big Christmas gift for them.''
	   The publication of the state-by-state population figures
presages the fight over more detailed population counts that will
be published in the spring and will provide counts down to the city
block that will be used in redistricting, from state legislatures
down to city councils and school boards.
	   Democrats and Republicans will fight fiercely over whether to
adjust population totals using a contentious method called
statistical sampling.
	   After the 1990 census when the Census Bureau estimated that it
had missed 4 million people and double counted another 4 million,
the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the Census Bureau
conduct a survey _ similar to a very sophisticated poll of 314,000
of households _ and use the data from that sample to adjust the
population counts.
	   Many Republicans, however, fought the idea, asserting that it
was illegal and would subject the census to political manipulation.
	   One subtext for the fight over adjusting is that a large
proportion of those missed by traditional census methods are poor
people and renters who tend to live in traditionally Democratic
areas. Including them in the final count through a statistical
adjustment, some argued, would help Democrats when legislative
boundaries were drawn.
	   Though the use of adjusted population counts would have a
greater impact on drawing boundaries than in the allocation of
House seats to states, officials in some states like California
with a high percentage of immigrants, say the Supreme Court ruling
probably costs them a House seat.
	   ``It's kind of like the Florida vote; we know we have the
numbers, but they won't allow the statistical adjustment,'' said
John Longville, the Democratic chairman of the California
Assembly's Committee on Elections, Reapportionment and
Constitutional Amendments.
	   Students of demographic and political trends say the figures due
out this week will show a slowing of the post-World War II shift of
population _ and with it political power _ away from the frosty
climates of the Northeast and the Midwest and toward the Sun Belt.
	   For example, California added seven House seats after the 1990
census as a result of a 25.7 percent increase in the state's
population during the 1980s. Battered by a deep recession in the
early part of the 1990s, California grew by about 12 percent during
the decade, and, as a result, will add only one more seat.
	   Even so, some Republican politicians feel that the continued
shift of political power to the Sun Belt will increase their
party's influence in Washington, especially when combined with the
election of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
	   ``I think you're going to to see a shift in emphasis to Western
issues, particularly when you see a president-elect and vice
president-elect from Texas and Wyoming,'' said Wes Marsh, an
Arizona state representative who is chairman of the State
Assembly's Redistricting Task Force.
