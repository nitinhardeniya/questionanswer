	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials have identified 10 of the 12 bodies
recovered from the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk as Russian and
Norwegian divers Saturday resumed their search for more bodies, a
navy official said.

	   The divers Saturday afternoon completed cutting a hole in the
inner hull over the fourth compartment in the vessel's forward area,
Northern Fleet spokesman Capt. Igor Babenko said.

	   High winds and snow later Friday forced a temporary halt to
divers' efforts to recover bodies from the Kursk, but they were able
on Saturday to resume their efforts to recover the bodies of the 118
sailors who died when the submarine exploded and sank Aug. 12.

	   The divers moved their search for bodies toward less damaged
areas of the vessel on Friday, after failing to enter a shattered
third forward compartment.

	   After the hole was cut into the fourth compartment, divers
circulated water to disperse the murk in the compartment and prepared
to take in television equipment, navy spokesman Capt. Valdimir
Navrotsky said on RTR television.

	   Another navy spokesman, Capt. Vadim Serga, said divers hoped to
find more crew remains in the fourth compartment, which served as
living quarters for the crew. The compartment held bunks, a kitchen
and a room for meetings and social activity.

	   Twelve bodies have been recovered so far, all of them from the
submarine's stern. Of the 12, 10 had been identified as of Saturday,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The identities of the two others
was expected to be established later Saturday, the news agency said.

	   At least 23 sailors survived the initial explosion in the
submarine's stern, as indicated by a letter found on the body of Lt.
Dmitry Kolesnikov.

	   The cause of the Kursk's sinking remains unknown. Russian
officials favor a theory that a collision with a foreign submarine
set off the powerful blasts. But others have said the most likely
reason was a torpedo exploding in its tube because of a technical
malfunction.

	   A state commission of inquiry into the sinking of the Kursk will
convene in Moscow on Wednesday, the Interfax news agency reported. It
said that the diving operation will be completed by the end of next
week.
