USS Cole Loses Power, More Flooding
</HEADLINE>

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The hobbled USS Cole lost power and took on
more water in Yemen's harbor on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, and the Clinton
administration renewed its pledge to be ``relentless'' in tracking
down those responsible for its bombing.

	   In what he called ``a minor setback'' to recovery operations,
naval operations chief Adm. Vern Clark said the ship's crew was
working to restore electrical power needed for communications and to
pump water out of the destroyer, which has a huge hole in its hull.

	   ``They're heroes _ they're fighting for their ship,'' he said on
CBS' ``Face the Nation.''

	   The power had been restored <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> after a suspected terrorist
bombing blew a 40-by-40 foot hole in the Cole, killing 17 sailors.

	   But officials said the generator system inexplicably failed again
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, stopping pumps and causing additional flooding.

	   The crew brought the flooding under control, Clark said.

	   Meantime, Defense Secretary William Cohen said there was no doubt
that the explosion was an intentional bombing.

	   ``We don't know who did it but ... we're satisfied this was
clearly an act of terrorism,'' he said on CBS.

	   ``We will be relentless in tracking down the individuals or
groups who are responsible for this and we will see to it that they
are held accountable''

	   President Clinton's national security adviser defended the Navy's
decision to dock ships in Yemen. Sandy Berger said limited fueling
options in the Persian Gulf require such stops despite the high risk
of terrorism.

	   ``This entire area is a high threat area. The military has taken
substantial steps in this area,'' he said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''

	   Berger said 25 ships have refueled in the Arabian Peninsula port
of Aden in <TIMEX2 val="P18M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past 18 months</TIMEX2> ``without incident.''

	   ``Obviously we have to find out what if anything happened in this
particular case,'' Berger said.

	   U.S. officials believe the ship was the target of a suicide
attack from a small vessel packed with powerful explosives. If
terrorism is proved, it would be the deadliest such attack on the
U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi
Arabia in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2> that killed 19.

	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on ABC's ``This Week''
that she thinks the inquiry is ``moving'' and the United States is
``getting a lot of people in there.''

	   Among the names mentioned in the wake of the bombing has been
Osama bin Laden. The United States accuses bin Laden of organizing a
network with followers across the Mideast, including Yemen, and says
he masterminded the <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2> bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa
that killed 224 people.

	   Clinton, in a letter <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> to Republican congressional
leaders, said more than 100 military personnel, plus two Navy
warships, were sent to Yemen to help with security, communications
and medical needs.

	   Berger said the Defense Department is investigating whether
future ships will continue to refuel in the area.

	   ``We need to wait for a very thorough review and determine if
anything more could have been done and should have been done,'' he
said.

	   Aden's convenient deep-water port had been used as a refueling
point for U.S. warships for <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">about two years</TIMEX2>. Discussions also had
been started on a possible permanent U.S. facility around Aden _ near
the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula and near the important
straits at the southern end of the Red Sea.
