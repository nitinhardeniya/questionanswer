Clinton Trip To N. Korea Considered

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ For <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">decades</TIMEX2>, North Korea seemed to
relish confrontation with the United States at the negotiating table,
a strategy that U.S. officials viewed as brinkmanship: ratchet up the
tension to win concessions.

	   <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-20" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">These days</TIMEX2>, threats, insults and walkouts have faded as North
Korean negotiating tools. So Washington's <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Cold War-era</TIMEX2> foe is sure to
lavish pomp and protocol on Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
a visit to North Korea <TIMEX2 val="2000-W43" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next week</TIMEX2>.

	   Albright, who leaves for Pyongyang on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, will likely be
treated to orderly crowds of well-wishers, theater performances and
toasts and handshakes with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. These
images of rapprochement could lead to a visit by President Clinton
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next month</TIMEX2>.

	   But there will also be blunt talk of the communist North's
missile program and its desire to get off a U.S. list of
terrorism-sponsoring nations _ issues that have stalled hopes for
permanent peace on the Korean peninsula since it was devastated by
war <TIMEX2 val="1950" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">50 years ago</TIMEX2>.

	   Both sides declared their intent to ``formally end the Korean
War'' by resolving these quandaries in a joint statement that was
released in Washington during a trip <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this month</TIMEX2> by Gen. Jo Myong Rok,
a top aide to Kim Jong Il.

	   The two sides might wait before tackling other complex topics
such as troop reductions and weapons withdrawals from the
Demilitarized Zone, a buffer zone separating the two Koreas.

	   ``These are very tough. It's going to take <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a while</TIMEX2> to work out.
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-20T17:22:11" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> the North is saying it's <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time to start</TIMEX2>,'' said Leon Sigal, author
of the book ``Disarming Strangers: Nuclear Diplomacy with North
Korea.''

	   The Albright visit is part of a coordinated strategy involving
Washington and its allies, South Korea and Japan, to end the North's
isolation and remove the threat of war in one of the world's most
volatile regions.

	   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il set the stage
for reconciliation by pledging at a summit in <TIMEX2 val="2000-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June</TIMEX2> to pursue
reunification. Kim Dae-jung won the Nobel Peace Prize <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> for
his peace efforts.

	   Meanwhile, Japan plans talks with North Korea in Beijing on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct.
30</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">31</TIMEX2> following two rounds held <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this year</TIMEX2>.

	   Europe is also responding to North Korea's attempts to shed its
image as a pariah state and attract international aid to revive its
economy and stave off food shortages. Britain and Germany plan to
open diplomatic relations soon.

	   Albright's meetings <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next Monday</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> in Pyongyang may
serve as an opportunity for the North to publicly clarify its stand
on the 37,000 U.S. soldiers based in South Korea.

	   Kim Dae-jung has said that Kim Jong Il acknowledged at their
summit that the U.S. military could play a role in Korea as
guarantors of regional security even after reunification. There are
fears in South Korea that the removal of U.S. forces could
destabilize the balance of power in Northeast Asia by emboldening
Japan and China.

	   A deal appears close on removing North Korea from Washington's
terrorism list, which bars all but humanitarian aid to the Pyongyang
government and forbids other economic benefits.

	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This month</TIMEX2>, Pyongyang met a U.S. condition for getting off the
list by issuing a joint statement with Washington renouncing all
forms of terrorism.

	   North Korea was put on the list because of involvement in the
bombing of a South Korean airliner near Burma, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-20T17:22:11" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> Myanmar, in <TIMEX2 val="1987" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1987</TIMEX2>,
that killed all 115 people on board.

	   North Korea, which rattled the region by test-firing a rocket
over Japan in <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2>, has offered to drop its long-range missile
program in return for billions of dollars in compensation.

	   U.S. officials have refused the offer, but some experts speculate
that Pyongyang might settle for aid and investment rather than a cash
payoff.

	   The fruits of the hard bargaining might only be announced during
a possible Clinton trip to Pyongyang.

	   ``Albright may try to draw attention to Clinton's visit by
announcing one or two small agreements such as opening liaison
offices,'' said Seo Joo-seok, an analyst at the state-run Korea
Institute for Defense Analysis.
