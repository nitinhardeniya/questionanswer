	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doubled over with back and joint pain, U.S.
businessman Edmond Pope was rushed to a Moscow prison clinic <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>
and his espionage trial was adjourned for <TIMEX2 val="P2D" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-31" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">at least two days</TIMEX2>, his
lawyer said.

	   Pope, 54, has suffered from bone cancer, but it was in remission
when he arrived in Russia <TIMEX2 val="2000-SP" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this spring</TIMEX2>. The court here had repeatedly
rejected Pope's earlier appeals to take his ailing health into
consideration or to allow English-speaking doctors to examine him.

	   Defense lawyer Pavel Astakhov speculated that Pope's attack
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> signals the cancer is resurfacing, something Pope's relatives
have long feared.

	   ``<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This morning</TIMEX2> he said he didn't feel well. Then, during the
trial's lunch break, he had a fit of serious pain,'' Astakhov said.

	   Pope was taken to the Lefortovo prison, where he has been held
since his arrest in <TIMEX2 val="2000-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April</TIMEX2>, and prison doctors determined he was
suffering severe inflammation in his joints and back, Astakhov said.

	   ``They brought us a statement from prison doctors that said for
<TIMEX2 val="P2D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-31" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">two days</TIMEX2> there is no way Edmond could take part in the trial,'' he
said. ``We think it's connected to his disease. The symptoms are the
same.''

	   Judge Nina Barkina adjourned the proceedings until <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="ON_OR_AFTER" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">at least
Thursday</TIMEX2>.

	   Astakhov was not allowed to speak to Pope after the incident. He
said he believed Pope had been returned to his cell.

	   The trial in a Moscow city court is being conducted behind closed
doors. Prosecutors in the case have refused to talk to reporters.

	   In <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>'s proceedings, Barkina refused to accept U.S. medical
documents relating to Pope's health on the grounds that the material
was in English and unacceptable in the Russian court. In Washington,
meanwhile, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher repeated a U.S.
plea for Pope's release.

	   Pope, a retired U.S. Navy officer from State College, Pa., was
arrested on <TIMEX2 val="2000-04-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April 3</TIMEX2> in Moscow on charges of trying to buy classified
plans for a high-speed torpedo used by the Russian Navy.

	   Pope has pleaded innocent. His supporters have said the plans
were for a <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">10-year-old</TIMEX2> technology that has already been sold abroad.
