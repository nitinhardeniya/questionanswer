	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) _ After falling short in Florida's
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-27T14:15:17" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>-certified presidential election, Al Gore is hunting in court for
the votes he needs to top George W. Bush.

	   His lawyers were filing challenges on several fronts <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, all
aimed at overcoming the 537-vote margin that Bush has over Gore in
the results certified <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday night</TIMEX2> by Secretary of State Katherine
Harris, a Bush supporter.

	   ``This is something that's too important to be decided in a
partisan environment,'' Gore attorney David Boies said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> on NBC.
``This is something that ought to be decided by impartial judges.''

	   To that end, Gore was contesting Harris' certification head-on in
Tallahassee, and also challenging the outcome in Palm Beach, Nassau
and Miami-Dade counties.

	   Separately, a hearing was scheduled in a Seminole County court
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> on allegations by a Democratic attorney that Republicans
tampered with absentee ballot applications. Boise said his team was
undecided about whether to make that complaint part of its contest.

	   Bush adviser James A. Baker III insisted it was time for all
legal contests to end.

	   ``I don't believe the people of America want this election turned
over to lawyers and court contests,'' he said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>. ``At some
point, the law must prevail and the lawyers must go home. We have
reached that point.''

	   Bush's lawyers have <TIMEX2 val="P10D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-27" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">10 days</TIMEX2> to respond to Gore's challenge
against the certification but probably would file papers much sooner
than that. The law allows for an ``immediate hearing'' on all
election contests, including witnesses and evidence.

	   <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This week</TIMEX2>'s grand finale is likely to be <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>'s hearing before
the U.S. Supreme Court.

	   ``What is at issue here is nothing less than every American's
simple, sacred right to vote,'' said Gore's running mate, Joseph
Lieberman, as he defended the decision to mount yet another legal
fight in the race for the White House.

	   Lieberman suggested that Harris' refusal to count partial returns
from Palm Beach County shortchanged its voters.

	   Charles Burton, chairman of the Palm Beach canvassing board,
called Harris' action ``a slap in the face'' to county workers who
labored hard to finish the hand recount.

	   One Bush adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
GOP camp would not be filing a contest of its own, but he indicated
that answers would be filed to the Gore litigation. And he said the
Bush forces did not intend to abandon their Supreme Court suit.

	   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> a coalition of civil rights
organizations intends to file a lawsuit on behalf of disenfranchised
voters in Florida under the Civil Rights Act.

	   In an interview, Jackson criticized the Justice Department and
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush _ the Texas governor's brother _ saying more
needs to be done to stop protests that intimidate minority voters,
and to ensure that no voters are disenfranchised in that state.

	   Boies said one of his first actions would be to petition for
counting thousands of votes he said were never tallied.

	   ``Until these votes are counted, this election cannot be over,''
Boies said. ``There are thousands of votes that haven't been counted
once.''

	   The Bush camp said those ballots were not ignored, but probably
represented 10,000 voters who purposely left their choice for
president blank while voting in other races.

	   In Nassau County, Democrats are seeking use of the recounted
total, which would give Gore 51 more votes.

	   In Miami-Dade, Boies wants a count of the 10,000 votes he said
could not be read by a voting machine and were not hand-counted.

	   In Palm Beach, the Gore lawyers want to include recounted votes.
In addition, they might challenge the results of ``butterfly
ballots'' that were said to have confused many voters into voting for
Pat Buchanan instead of Gore.
