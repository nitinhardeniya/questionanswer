	   BEIJING _ ``You need to look at the legs and examine the jaws,
and you need to see if the lines on the head are straight,'' Meng
Yu was saying, admiring the animals before him like any connoisseur
of fine breeds.
	   Wang Delu, who sat nearby in the back-alley market, said: ``Now
just look at this one, I call him the gold-tipped general. See,
there's a patch of gold at the top of his head. He should make a
good fighter.''
	   The men were talking, of course, about crickets. Autumn is the
cricket-fighting season in China, a time when aficionados spend
their days examining little brown bugs that were captured in
distant fields, noting obscure physical details and behaviors in a
never-ending quest for the true gladiator.
	   These cricket mavens apply the lore of centuries and gambler's
intuition to a search for insects that will dominate all rivals in
battle, and along the way, many of the masters dearly hope, win a
bundle of cash from sideline betting.
	   The bugs are not to be confused with the crickets kept in little
cages and ornate gourds as companions, which include large,
colorful species and tiny ones with mellifluous chirps. Fighting
crickets are no more than an inch and a half long, and to the
untrained eye they look like, well, ordinary brown crickets. Always
male, they must have the physique and character to go head-to-head
in the 8-inch plastic arena _ to butt and grab and flip an opponent
until it surrenders or is maimed.
	   Cricket matches have been popular for at least 1,000 years, and
the sport was once popular with emperors as well as commoners.
Today, neighborhood bouts are still staged among friends for small
antes, while serious cricket fanciers in Beijing, Shanghai and a
few other cities belong to associations that nurture the tradition,
holding a national championship each October.
	   But more and more, the sport is dominated by hard-core gamblers,
who stage secret matches for stakes that run into the thousands of
dollars, risking police raids for the illegal betting. In big
matches, fans say, crickets are even doped with a secret formula
that is said to make them fiercer.
	   People with a passion for crickets, like Lan Yindong, 44, whose
father and grandfather also sold cricket paraphernalia in Beijing,
rue the sport's decline in social status and its close association
with gambling.
	   ``Cricket fighting attracts so many hooligans now, it's not like
before,'' said Lan, to the soft purr of an especially fine-sounding
cricket he kept nearby. ``It's good for my business, but I don't
like all the gambling.''
	   On a recent night, about 20 cricket masters, members of two
neighborhood teams from the loosely organized Beijing Cricket
Society, met at an old courtyard-style house for a friendly match.
	   The men, avid hobbyists in their 40s, 50s and 60s who included
an engineer, midlevel city officials and retired workers, smoked
and talked as they put a female in each fighter's jar before the
match, said to stir up the fighting juices. They used a small scale
to weigh each fighter, matching up equals for the bouts. Then the
men became quiet and intent as the battles began, with crickets
dropped into the arena two at a time.
	   Many matches ended in unsatisfying TKO's as some bugs refused to
fight, repeatedly running away when stroked with a fine brush by a
master. But the bolder fighters rushed at each other relentlessly,
grasping each other with their large jaws, rising up together with
their legs tautly extended like two miniature sumo wrestlers and
drawing smiles and laughs from the crowd. The bugs twisted and
flipped their opponents until one retreated or was declared a clear
loser.
	   The winners will fight again another day, the men said _ often
five or six times before they lose their edge. Losers are tossed
away.
	   In his back-street shop, Meng opened up the dozens of small clay
jars before him, each holding a cricket for sale, most at prices
ranging from 35 cents to a few dollars. But exceptional-looking
specimens can sell for hundreds of dollars.
	   Meng described some of the subtle ways to categorize crickets:
the six possible colors on the body and head, the straightness of
the ``fighting lines'' on the head, the size of the legs and jaws.
Good-looking crickets must be tested out for aggressiveness, too.
	   But when all is said and done, Meng said, ``it's not something
you can explain.''
	   ``It's like in boxing, when some people think Tyson is the best,
some people look at Holyfield and think he's the best,'' he said.
	   As every cricket fancier knows, the top fighters all come from a
single region of eastern China, Shandong Province. Thousands of men
from around the country travel there in August and September to buy
large quantities from farmers who have plucked the summer's yield
of bugs from their fields.
	   ``Shandong has the best water and soil, but every county has
different qualities and some years are better than others,'' Lan
said, sounding more like an expert on chateau burgundies than on
crickets.
	   Through the fall _ the crickets live for only three months _
players search endlessly for the best, some making multiple trips
to Shandong and constantly scouring the street markets for that
special find.
	   Lan said he sold the best cricket he ever found _ one from
Shandong's best county, with excellent traits but still untested in
battle _ to an avid fan for more than $700. So did this fine,
costly animal win in the arena?
	   ``I can't say for sure,'' Lan said with a smile.
