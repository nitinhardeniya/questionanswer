Environmentalists Sue Over Grazing

	   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) _ A coalition of environmental and hunting
groups has sued the Forest Service to restrict livestock grazing they
say endangers threatened species on millions of acres in the Rockies.

	   The coalition, led by Santa Fe-based Forest Guardians, filed the
lawsuit <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> in federal court in Tucson, Ariz.

	   The lawsuit claims the agency violated the Endangered Species Act
and a <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2> promise to restrict grazing in 11 national forests in New
Mexico and Arizona to protect the threatened Mexican spotted owl.

	   Environmentalists say overgrazing destroys the habitat for
species protected by federal law. Forest Guardians spokesman John
Horning said the government is violating grazing rules on more than
80 percent of its 1,400 grazing allotments.

	   Pat Jackson, who manages Southwest litigation for the Forest
Service, said he couldn't comment on the lawsuit. But he agreed the
agency is not completely in compliance with the Endangered Species
Act.

	   ``We're not 100 percent, but we're making progress,'' he said.
``The Forest Service is very serious about protecting threatened and
endangered species.''

	   The agency is trapped between environmentalists and cattle
growers in an ongoing debate over grazing on public lands, he said.
The New Mexico Cattle Growers Association said it would consider
intervening in the lawsuit.

	   It was the second time the Forest Service had been sued over
grazing in <TIMEX2 val="P1W" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">little more than a week</TIMEX2>. On <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 20</TIMEX2>, the Tucson-based
Center for Biological Diversity sued the agency over grazing
practices.
