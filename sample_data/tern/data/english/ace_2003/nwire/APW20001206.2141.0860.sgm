U.S. Objects To American's Sentence

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The White House criticized as ``unjustified and
wrong'' a Russian court's conviction Wednesday of American
businessman Edmond Pope on charges of illegally obtaining classified
blueprints for a high-speed torpedo.

	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov to stress U.S. concern over Pope's heath and to
urge his release from prison, said a State Department spokesman,
Philip Reeker, who would not disclose Ivanov's response.

	   At the White House, spokesman Jake Siewert demanded Pope's
release on humanitarian grounds _ he is believed to be suffering from
a rare form of bone cancer. ``There's no doubt'' the case has cast a
shadow over U.S.-Russian relations, Siewert said.

	   ``We will continue to pursue a multifaceted relationship with
Russia based on what we think is in America's long-term strategic
interest,'' Siewert said.

	   The 54-year-old Pope, a retired U.S. Navy officer, was sentenced
to 20 years in prison.

	   Members of Congress urged President Clinton to press Russian
President Vladimir Putin to intercede and gain Pope's release. ``The
president has expressed his concern about Mr. Pope on a number of
levels,'' Siewert said.

	   ``We think he hasn't had proper medical care there _ that it's
important that the Russian government recognize on humanitarian
grounds that he should be allowed to return to the United States and
receive proper medical care,'' Siewert said.

	   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., urged Clinton to
contact Putin and demand Pope's safe return to his family in State
College, Pa.

	   ``His health has visibly deteriorated possibly due to a
recurrence of a very rare form of bone cancer,'' Specter wrote. His
letter said Pope had pursued technology that is commercially
available and advertised for sale by Russian authorities.

	   Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., said the sentence was ``an inexcusable
travesty of justice'' and that if Russia forces Pope ``to serve
prison time for a crime he did not commit, that country's
relationship with the U.S. will be forever scarred.''

	   Sen. Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore., said the verdict was ``another sign
that Russia lacks the basic legal protections necessary if it is to
shed its reputation as a `thugocracy,'''

	   Clinton and his administration were accused by Rep. Curt Weldon,
R-Pa., of not doing enough for Pope. ``They let him languish for
months and didn't demand to free this innocent man,'' he said.

	   All along, the State Department had insisted the charges should
be dropped, cited Pope's health and criticized Russian officials for
giving U.S. diplomats and an American physician only limited access
to the prisoner.

	   If Pope is not released promptly, the conviction is bound to be
on Albright's agenda when she meets later this month with Ivanov in
Belgium.

	   Pope, on trial since Oct. 18, insisted on his innocence. He
contended that the torpedo plans were not secret because they had
been sold abroad and published.

	   U.S. relations with Moscow have slumped even as the two countries
collaborated in trying to compel the Taliban group that controls most
of Afghanistan to hand over Osama bin Laden for trial in the United
States on terrorism charges.

	   On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher criticized
a Russian decision to exempt residents of breakaway regions of
Georgia from rules tightening the issuance of visas for Georgians to
enter Russia.

	   Last week, the State Department made public a Russian decision to
terminate a 5-year-old pledge to halt sales of tanks and other
battlefield equipment to Iran.

	   The pledge was terminated Friday, but this week Boucher said
there was no evidence Russia had resumed arms sales to Iran. A U.S.
delegation was sent this week to Moscow to ask for a reversal.
