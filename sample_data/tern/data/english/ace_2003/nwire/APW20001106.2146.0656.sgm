	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Divers labored Monday to clear the jumble of debris
in a compartment of the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk, hoping to
find bodies of some of the 118 men who died when it exploded and
sank, the Russian navy said.

	   The compartment, which includes the submarine's living and
service areas, is strewn with instruments and machinery, some of
which had to be cut apart and removed, said Capt. Vadim Serga, a
spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet.

	   Since cutting a hole into the compartment Sunday, the divers have
not been able to move more than about six feet into the compartment,
where officials have said the bodies of 12 seamen may be found, Serga
said.

	   Relatively calm weather in the Barents Sea was aiding the work,
Serga said, but weather forecasts indicated heavy winds may hit the
region Monday night.

	   Although the divers are working 350 feet below the surface,
severe weather could force suspension of the recovery effort because
high waves toss the ships to which the divers are connected by
tethers.

	   So far, only 12 bodies have been recovered from the submarine,
which sank Aug. 12. Because of the intensity of the explosion that
shattered the vessel, officials say many of the bodies may have been
blown apart.

	   All the bodies recovered so far were found in the submarine's
stern.

	   At least 23 sailors survived the initial explosion in the rear of
the vessel, as indicated by a letter found on the body of Lt. Dmitry
Kolesnikov.

	   Twelve bodies have been recovered and identified. On Monday,
officials released the names of two more bodies that had been
identified as Seaman Roman Kubikov and Petty Officer Vyacheslav
Mainagashev, the Interfax news agency reported.

	   The cause of the Kursk's sinking remains unknown. Russian
officials favor a theory that a collision with a foreign submarine
set off the powerful blasts. But others have said the most likely
reason was a torpedo exploding in its tube because of a technical
malfunction.

	   A state commission of inquiry into the sinking of the Kursk is to
convene in Moscow on Wednesday, according to Russian news reports.

	   Also Monday, a chapel built as a gift to submariners was opened
in Vidyayevo, which had been the Kursk's home, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. The log chapel was built by carpenters from
Kostroma, a city noted for its wooden architecture.
