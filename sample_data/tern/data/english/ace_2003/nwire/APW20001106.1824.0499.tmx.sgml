	   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) _ George Hackett, an Associated Press
newsman who chronicled Kentucky for <TIMEX2 val="P6DE" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1944" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">nearly six decades</TIMEX2>, died <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>
following a brief illness. He was 82.

	   He had undergone abdominal surgery in early <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September</TIMEX2>.

	   Hackett started his career in <TIMEX2 val="1944" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1944</TIMEX2> as a Wirephoto operator and
later held several supervisory positions, including news editor. He
spent his entire career in his native Louisville and most recently
was Kentucky enterprise editor.

	   ``George Hackett arguably wrote more stories read by more people
than any other journalist in Kentucky,'' said Ed Staats, Louisville
bureau chief.

	   ``George trained a generation of young AP writers and editors,''
said David Hawpe, editorial director of The Courier-Journal in
Louisville and <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06T18:47:19" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> AP employee. ``He was a gentle, kind,
thoughtful, funny human being. And a superb, spare writer.''

	   Walter Dear, <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06T18:47:19" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> owner and publisher of The Gleaner at
Henderson, wrote in a <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2> column about Hackett's greatest scoop. It
came in the aftermath of the <TIMEX2 val="1968" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1968</TIMEX2> Kentucky Derby, when officials
disqualified apparent winner Dancer's Image.

	   ``A Churchill Downs public relations man gave me a piece of paper
saying that Dancer's Image had some forbidden medicine in his
system,'' Hackett told Dear. ``I got to the phone in a hurry and beat
the competition by <TIMEX2 val="PT15M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">15 minutes</TIMEX2>.''

	   In <TIMEX2 val="1981" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1981</TIMEX2>, Hackett was presented the Distinguished Service of
Journalism award by Western Kentucky University. He was inducted into
the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame at the University of Kentucky in
<TIMEX2 val="1988" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1988</TIMEX2>.

	   Survivors include his wife, Mickey, a watercolor painter.

	   There will be no funeral service.
