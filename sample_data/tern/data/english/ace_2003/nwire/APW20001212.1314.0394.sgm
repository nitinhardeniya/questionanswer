	   Developments Monday in the Florida presidential election recount:

	   COURTS:

	   _ In Washington, the Supreme Court peppered lawyers for George W.
Bush and Al Gore with questions for 90 minutes. The justices set no
timetable for a ruling on whether to resume a recount of Florida's
questionable ballots.

	   Several justices expressed concern about varying standards for
recounts. Bush attorney Theodore Olson told them, ``There is no
question ... that there are different standards from county to
county'' for recounts.

	   _ In Tallahassee, Fla., the state Supreme Court clarified its
earlier ruling extending deadlines for hand counts in three counties,
saying the ruling was based on Florida statutes. The U.S. Supreme
Court had set aside the ruling and asked the court to explain how the
ruling was consistent with Florida law.

	   _ An Atlanta appeals court agreed with a federal judge who
refused to throw out 2,400 of Florida's overseas ballots, mostly from
military personnel, because they arrived after Election Day.

	   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said the ruling by U.S. District Judge Maurice Paul in Gainesville,
Fla., was consistent with recent comments by Florida's highest court
about the workings of the absentee ballot law.

	   FLORIDA:

	   _In Tallahassee, legislation appointing a slate of presidential
electors loyal to George W. Bush advanced in the
Republican-controlled Florida Legislature.

	   The measures were on track for a final vote later this week.

	   The vote was a party-line 4-3 in the Senate, but one Democrat
defected in the House.

	   The two committees voted a few hours after lawyers for Bush and
Gore wrapped up 90 minutes of arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court
over the state's contested presidential election.

	   ELSEWHERE:

	   _In Austin, Texas, Bush pronounced himself calm and ``cautiously
optimistic'' as he awaited the Supreme Court decision that could be
crucial in resolving the presidential election.

	   He had no public appearances scheduled for the day but chatted
with reporters twice on the steps of the state Capitol _ once as he
headed for his office and again as he left.

	   _Gore waited out the hearing at home in Washington with his wife
Tipper. Three of their four children _ Karenna, Kristin and Albert
III _ accompanied campaign chairman William Daley and former
secretary of state Warren Christopher, the head of Gore's legal team,
to the Supreme Court chamber to hear arguments. Daughter Sarah was at
school in Boston.

	   QUOTES:

	   ``I represent a good district, very good people and I listen to
them,'' said Democratic Rep. Dwight Stansel, whose district voted
heavily for Bush. ``If you don't listen to them, you'll be home.
Someone else will be listening to them.''
