Navies Stage Joint Submarine Rescue

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Navies from the United States, Japan, South
Korea and Singapore on Monday began the first combined submarine
rescue exercise in the Pacific.

	   The 13-day Exercise Pacific Reach 2000 involves 600 people, four
ships, four submarines and three sophisticated underwater devices
that can rescue personnel from submarines in distress.

	   The joint exercise in the South China Sea off Singapore was
planned nearly two years before the recent Russian submarine disaster
that killed 118 people, but participants said the disaster heightened
the importance of submarine rescue.

	   ``This is the first time we've really had the chance to work
together in a regional submarine rescue exercise in the Pacific,''
said Lt. Leslie Hull-Ryde, a Navy spokeswoman in Singapore.

	   The navies' working together will promote ``greater understanding
and also a commitment to stability'' in the Asia-Pacific region,
Hull-Ryde said.

	   The Navy has begun venturing into shallower coastal waters and
will use the exercise to test its shallow-water rescue capabilities,
said Navy Capt. C.J. Leidig, deputy coordinator of the exercise.

	   ``We are looking to operate in more shallow waters in recent
years as we make the transition from a Cold War, blue-water navy to a
more littoral (coastal) type strategy, so shallow water submarine
rescue has become important,'' Leidig said.

	   Exercise Pacific Reach is taking place in about 231 feet to 264
feet of water _ considered shallow for submarines _ Leidig told a
news conference Monday.

	   Russia, China, Britain, Australia, Canada, Chile and Indonesia
have sent observers to this week's exercise 230 miles northeast of
Singapore.

	   During the exercise, some of the submarines will sit on the
bottom ``simulating disabled subs,'' Leidig said.

	   Underwater rescue devices such as a Navy high-tech ``diving
bell'' will be attached to the submarines' hatches and transfer crew
to the rescue vehicle. Special diving suits will also be used.

	   The U.S. Navy nuclear attack submarine USS Helena is taking part,
along with submarines JDS Akishio of Japan, South Korea's ROKS Choi
Moo Sun and Singapore's RSS Conqueror.

	   Japan, South Korea and Singapore are sending rescue support ships
to the exercise, while the United States, Japan and South Korea are
sending underwater rescue vehicles.

	   Japan's equivalent of a naval force is officially referred to as
the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Since Japan was defeated in
World War II and formally renounced military aggression, its armed
forces are constitutionally limited to a self-defense role.

	   Submarine emergencies grabbed world attention in August when
Russia's Kursk nuclear submarine sank after an explosion.

	   Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, were
criticized for slow and awkward handling of the incident.
