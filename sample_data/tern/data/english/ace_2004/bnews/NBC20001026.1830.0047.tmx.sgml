<TIMEX2 val="TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">good evening</TIMEX2>. there isn't a national poll in the race between vice
president al gore and governor george w. bush that shows a clear
advantage for one or the other with <TIMEX2 val="P2WE" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="2004-W43" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">two weekends to go</TIMEX2>. according to
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s msnbc/reuters tracking poll, gore is hanging onto a
two-point lead over bush for <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the second day in a row</TIMEX2>. but all these
polls, it's important to point out , are within a margin of error
that could flip the results. what they're really telling us is that
the race appears to be a dead heat. and with <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> running short, the
final strategies are taking a sharper form. nbc's david gregory is
with the governor again <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-26TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, claire shipman with the vice

tom, the greening of al gore <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> -- his environmental message
hasn't always been a priority on the campaign trail, but <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-26T18:30:47.70" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, with
fears of ralph nader's growing support, it could be critical. al

why? it's a message that appeals to those critical undecided voters
and especially the supporters of this man, ralph nader. once a minor
distraction, gore aides <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-26T18:30:47.70" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> fear nader could cost them the election.
how much can nader hurt? take oregon, a state gore was counting on.
a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-26T18:30:47.70" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> poll has bush at 45%, gore at 41% and nader at 10%. in
traditionally democratic minnesota, bush has 44%, gore 41%, nader
8%. here in wisconsin, gore has an edge in one poll, bush in
another. nader remains steady at 5%. those statistics have democrats
cranking up the head on nader supporters. <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-26T18:30:47.70" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> gore rival bill

organizations are spending big money for ads like this one to make
the case that a vote for nader could mean the end of a woman's right
to choose.

before voting nader, consider the risk. it's your choice.
environmental groups are also getting involved. some prominent
democrats are thinking about a full-page ad in "the new york times."
