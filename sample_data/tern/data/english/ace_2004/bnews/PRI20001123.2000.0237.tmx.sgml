In China a campaign against fake goods has netted 43 million dollars
of counterfeit products over <TIMEX2 val="P1M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past month</TIMEX2>. The trade in bogus
goods is thought to cost companies tens of billions of dollars and
lost revenues <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">each year</TIMEX2>. But officials say enforcing the law is
often dangerous with at least one government inspector killed in
<TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W47" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">recent weeks</TIMEX2>. Officials say some corrupt local government officials
are protecting the pirates. The BBC's, Duncan Hewat reports from
Shanghai.

Multinational companies investing in China had become so angry that
they <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T20:03:57.41" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> set up an anti-piracy league in Beijing to pressure
the Chinese government to take action. Domestic manufacturers, who
are also suffering, launched a similar body this month. China
<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T20:03:57.41" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> introduced a new law increasing fines against producers of
fake goods from the amount of profit made to the value of the goods
produced, but many observers say this is still not a sufficient
deterrent. Chinese media have said that fake products are
humiliating the nation and undermining public morality. And while
the fakes are often so well packaged that even the real
manufacturers can't tell the difference, the products inside are
often downright dangerous. China says it is determined to tackle the
problem as part of its moves towards joining the World Trade
Organization. The BBC's Duncan Hewat.
