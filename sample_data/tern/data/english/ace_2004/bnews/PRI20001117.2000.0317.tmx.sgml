If the United States has officially restored diplomatic relations
with Yugoslavia, President Clinton announced the move during his
visit to Vietnam, calling the changes in Yugoslavia remarkable,
following the democratic election of President Vojislav Kostunica
and the ouster of Slobodan Milosevic. The White House said the
United States will provide 45 million dollars in food aid to
Yugoslavia. This is NPR news from Washington.
