peace track. united nations secretary general kofi annan <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>
discussed plans for the summit with the host, egyptian president
hosni mubarak. afterwards, he said the crisis in the middle east was
a threat with implications beyond the region, with possible negative
effects on oil prices and the world economy. both sides are
pessimistic about the outcome of the summit. barak told his cabinet
he believes the palestinian leadership is not ready to make
compromises that would bring lasting peace. he said u.s. help will
continue to be crucial. 
<TURN>
i believe that an end to violence could be accomplished, and in a
way should be accomplished. i believe that the mechanism for making
kind of tighter control, maybe american, israeli, palestinian
mechanism to make sure that the security understandings are working.
palestinian leaders are also issuing a bleak forecast. one senior
negotiator urged everyone not to have high expectations. a
palestinian council member says anger is growing. 
<TURN>
even the language betrays a sort of racist mentality, where they
view the palestinian people as either a regimented army or a herd of
sheep to be given orders and to be led blindly. no, the palestinian
people have a will of their own. they have been long victimized.
they have suffered under the peace process and under the israeli
occupation. in a way with is most brutal and violent. the israelis
have been losing the peace process as a cover to perpetuate the
occupation. and, therefore, the feelings of grievance, anger,
justice, and vict maization have been breaking up.
