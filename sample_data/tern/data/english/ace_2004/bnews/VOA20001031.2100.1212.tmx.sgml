Major League baseball's National League champion New York Mets
fortified their teams leadership on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> by resigning Manager
Bobby Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips. One of the Mets
owners, Nelson Doubleday told a New York newspaper that Valentine's
contract was for <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">three years</TIMEX2> at $7.5 million and with Phillips was
for <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">three years</TIMEX2> at $3 million. The <TIMEX2 val="P50Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">fifty-year-old</TIMEX2> Valentine replaced
Dallas Green as the Mets manager on <TIMEX2 val="1996-08-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August 26th, 1996</TIMEX2>. Since <TIMEX2 val="1996-08-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">then</TIMEX2>,
he has led the team to <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four consecutive winning seasons</TIMEX2>, including
back-to-back <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">post season</TIMEX2> berths and the franchise's first trip to
the World Series in <TIMEX2 val="P14Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">14 years</TIMEX2>. Valentine said he knew he wanted to
stay in New York. 
<TURN>
We think after the last game when Mike and Fonse and Alan John
amongst the others, came in and literally asked me to stay. That I
knew at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that time</TIMEX2>, probably could have offered a lot less, that I
was going to stay. 
<TURN>
Valentine had been under contract through <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31T24:00:00" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">midnight Tuesday</TIMEX2>, while
Phillips was under contract through <TIMEX2 val="2000-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December</TIMEX2>. By resigning Valentine
before his contract expired, the Mets avoided a bidding war for his
services. The Cincinnati Reds had expressed an interest in him and
the Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Toronto Blue
Jays are also without managers.
