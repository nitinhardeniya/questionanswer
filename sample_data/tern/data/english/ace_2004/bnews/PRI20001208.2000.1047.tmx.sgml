President Clinton departs <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> for Ireland, Northern Ireland and
England. The trip will provide the President with a first hand look
at how well the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-5" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Good Friday</TIMEX2> peace accord he helped broker is taking
hold in Northern Ireland. It is a glass is half-full-or-half-empty
situation there. On the one hand politicians in Northern Ireland
work co-operatively on a budget and government programs for the
first time in <TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">30 years</TIMEX2>. However there is continuing friction over
other aspects of the peace process. Belfast comedian Patrick Kealty
has his take on Mr. Clinton's visit.

gone belly-up for him so like we are all he's got left, so he is
kind of coming back and he is clinging and saying, you know, "Please
make it work, please". So I think that, I think it was meant to be a
lap of honor whether or not he salvages the peace process because we
have actually had too much of the President. In a way presidents
don't normally pay as much attention to Northern Ireland as Clinton
has, so he has actually paid the Irish question probably too much
attention for a president. And what that means is that the people
involved in the peace process here believe they are more important
than they actually are. And when the President talks <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="this is an odd construction. it means more like 'now we are in the last few months...'">five years ago</TIMEX2>
we would have listened and we would have been scared. Where as <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-08T20:17:27.58" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>,
it is like, "Here we go, Bill-smill".

Belfast comedian Patrick Kealty will resurface <TIMEX2 val="2000-W50" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next week</TIMEX2> on our show
when The World's Jennifer Glass reports on President Clinton's trip
to Ireland and Northern Ireland.
