From BBC news in London, I am Gregor Cragey for The World. George W.
Bush has met with Al Gore in Washington. The two men met for <TIMEX2 val="PT15M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-19" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">just 15
minutes</TIMEX2> at the Vice President's official residence. It's the first
time they've been face to face since the bitterly contested
presidential election was finally concluded <TIMEX2 val="2000-W50" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>. Bush went
into the talks with his defeated rival after meeting with President
Clinton <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier today</TIMEX2>. At a photo opportunity in the Oval Office,
Bush thanked the President and fended off an interruption from a
veteran White House correspondent. 
<TURN>
I am humbled and honored, and I can't thank the President enough for
his hospitality, he didn't need to do this. 
<TURN>
Yes, he did. 
<TURN>
I haven't quite finished yet. 
<TURN>
And I am grateful and I am going to look forward to the discussion.
I am here to listen. 
<TURN>
For his part President Clinton said his only advice to Bush is to
assemble a good team and to do what he thinks is right. Bush is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-19T20:30:28.07" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>
heading back to Texas.
