One of the largest cases of alleged sexual abuse by a Catholic
priest is being settled. The archdiocese of Portland has apologized
to 22 men who say they were molested by an Oregon priest when they
were altar boys. Jeff Brady reports from Oregon Public Broadcasting. 
<TURN>
The men say they were abused by Maurice Grammond as far back as <TIMEX2 val="1950" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">50
years ago</TIMEX2>. As part of the settlement, the men will receive money
though the exact amount is being kept confidential. The agreement
also calls for an apology from the Portland archdiocese that will be
read from the pulpit of every parish in Western Oregon at <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-7" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>
Mass. Attorney David Slater represented the alleged victims.

These men were burdened through their childhood, and into adulthood,
and even in the middle age with an overwhelming sense of shame and
isolation. With few exceptions they kept this experience and the
shame around it a secret even from their own wives.

Maurice Grammond is now 80 and lives in the Alzheimer's Unit of a
Nursing Home. He never faced criminal charges for the alleged abuse
because the statute of limitations expired <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-10T20:02:39.12" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">long ago</TIMEX2>. For NPR News,
