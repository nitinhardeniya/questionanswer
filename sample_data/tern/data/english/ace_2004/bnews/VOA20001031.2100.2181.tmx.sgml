The Pentagon denies US warships are steering clear of the Suez Canal
in the wake of the apparent terrorist bombing of the destroyer Cole
in Yemen although none has used the Canal, since the attack on the
Cole <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this month</TIMEX2>. VOA's Alex Belida reports security along
the Suez is being re-evaluated. At <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the same time</TIMEX2>, US forces in two
gulf countries have been put on alert against possible terrorist
action.

Pentagon Spokesman, Ken Baken, says US forces in Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia have <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31T21:36:21.74" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">now</TIMEX2> been placed on threat condition delta, the highest
state of alert. The move ordered <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, follows the earlier
decision to place US forces in Bahrain and Qatar on the same delta
status, because of terrorist threats. US forces in the Yemeni harbor
of Aden were elevated to delta immediately following the deadly
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October 12th</TIMEX2> terrorist bombing of US destroyer Cole. Mr. Baken says
the heightened alert in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, affects some 10,000
US military personnel in those two countries. He says it was ordered
because of what he termed credible threats, but he says no targets
were specified. The Pentagon spokesman is meanwhile disputing news
reports saying the Defense Department has decided to order US navy
ships to temporarily stop using the Suez Canal out of fear of
terrorist attack. Mr. Baken says no such instructions have been
given, but he acknowledges security along the Canal is being
constantly evaluated. 
<TURN>
We are evaluating with the Egyptians. Obviously, the security
situation in the Canal, we do that all the time. So, with the
Egyptians we both have a very fundamental interest in keeping the
Canal secure. 
<TURN>
No US ships have transited through the Canal since before the
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October 12th</TIMEX2> attack on the US destroyer Cole in Aden, but Mr. Baken
says no ships were scheduled to make the trip for <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W41" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">several weeks</TIMEX2>. The
badly damaged Cole has been towed out of Aden Harbor and is being
loaded aboard a Norwegian owned heavy lift ship called the Blue
Merlin. Mr. Bake, says no decision has yet been made on the route
the Blue Merlin will take to return the destroyer to the United
States for repairs. Alex Belida, VOA News, the Pentagon.
