unlike <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">sunday night</TIMEX2>'s clashes, no warning was given to residents in
beit jala to evacuate. my children and i were in a room in our
apartment on the second floor, he says, but when the gunfire
started, we went downstairs to the first floor. as you can see, the
gunfire was attacking our home. the residents of gilo, too, were
surveying the damage. what can i do, he says? i bought this
apartment <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">seven years ago</TIMEX2>. i thought it would be quiet. i cannot go
onto terrace, i cannot put my lights on. gilo is situated on a hill
overlooking beit jala in the valley below. it was built on territory
seized from the arabs in the <TIMEX2 val="1967" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1967</TIMEX2> war. israeli consider it part of
jerusalem. the palestinians claim it was built on land belonging to
beit jala. elsewhere, in the west bank town of hebron, one
palestinian man was killed during clashes with israeli soldiers.
israeli defense force officials say he was a member of the tanzim
militia, an arm of the fatah party, a charge denied by the
palestinians. meanwhile in jerusalem, prime minister ehud barak
continues his efforts to form a government of national emergency.
talks with the leader of the right-wing likud party, ariel sharon,
ended without agreement <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monday</TIMEX2>, but israeli government sources say
they are confident a deal can be struck before the knesset
reconvenes after the <TIMEX2 val="2000-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">summer</TIMEX2> recess <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next monday</TIMEX2>. palestinians say
that if ariel sharon is included in any new government, it will
spell the end of the peace process. meanwhile the israel yl military
says it is hunkering down for military clashes. in the words of one
brigadier general, "we are not talking about a short-lived
adventure." the palestinians, too, say they expect a drawn-out
conflict, playing barrack for calling an ent to the fighting.
