you don't need to be able to smell or see air pollution to die from
it. that's from a survey of the nation's 20 largest cities conducted
by the johns hopkins school of public health. it finds small
particles less than one-fifth the width of a human hair are enough
to raise the death rate. the study supports federal air quality
standards set 13 years ago. the pollution comes from sources
including power plants, agriculture and even from bits of car brakes
and tires.
