From NPR News in Washington, I am Corey Flintoff. President Clinton
charged Republicans <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> with having closed the door to compromise
on a spending bill. He says he will veto a House passed package that
combines a minimum wage increase with tax cuts. Republicans defended
their actions <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. NPR's Brian Naylor reports.

It's not what the Republican leaders wanted in <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the days leading up
to the election</TIMEX2>, a messy veto confrontation with the president, but
it's looking increasingly like that's with they are getting.

38 billion-dollar spending bill, which the Senate passed <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-27TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
afternoon</TIMEX2>. Lawmakers will work over <TIMEX2 val="2000-W43" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the weekend</TIMEX2> on the remaining

House Appropriations Committee Chairman, C.W. Bill Young expressed
some exasperation on the House floor <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> with the administration.

If they can't have it their way, they don't want it anyway. So,
wait,wait.
