The United States responded cautiously <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> to a declaration by
Iraq that it would resume oil exports to fulfill existing contracts.
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said there is no
confirmation as yet that Iraq has in fact begun allowing the loading
of oil tankers. 
<TURN>
The UN overseers report that Iraq is not allowing loadings into
tankers. We reiterate Iraq is the one who has chosen to suspend oil
exports, even though, the Security Council agreed to allow shipments
to continue while the UN and Iraq concluded a pricing mechanism to
reflect a fair market value for <TIMEX2 val="2000-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December</TIMEX2> exports. And once again we
make quite clear we continue our work with other governments and
with the International Energy Agency, and we are ready to take
action to add supply very quickly as this situation should warm up. 
<TURN>
On <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> Iraq backed away from an oil export halt that it had
called <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two days earlier</TIMEX2>.
