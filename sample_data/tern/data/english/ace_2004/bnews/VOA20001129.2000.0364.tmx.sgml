Welcome to <TIMEX2 val="PT1H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">this hour of VOA News Now</TIMEX2>. I'm Erin Brumett in
Washington. The incredibly close Florida vote count for President is
in the state courts and heading for the US Supreme Court at <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end
of the week</TIMEX2>. That's virtually unprecedented, as the Federal Courts
have tended to stay out of elections, which are the responsibility
of the states. Joe O'Grossman is a professor of constitutional law
at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University. He says that in this
instance the Supreme Court probably felt the circumstances were such
that they had no real alternative but to take the case. 
<TURN>
Well, I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such
a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try
to reject it out of hand. In fact, I think that Lawrence Tribe, the
Harvard Law School Professor who is arguing for Gore <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2>, is
going to ask the court to hold the case, moot and dismiss it. And
the Bush campaign has brought the case, but recognizes that the
particular issues that they brought to the court <TIMEX2 val="2000-W47" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> are
really not very relevant anymore. They are going to probably, well,
I know what they are going to do. They are going to try to broaden
the case to make it a kind of a general referendum on election
procedures. So, they are looking for a coronation. And the Gore
people at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:06:04.76" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">this point</TIMEX2> just want to get rid of this case, because they
think they have a better chance in the Florida courts. 
<TURN>
Republicans generally support states' rights. So, does it appear
somewhat ironic that they are going to the Supreme Court in this
instance? 
<TURN>
No, I think first of all the notion that Republicans favor states'
rights and Democrats oppose it, is much too simplistic. That's
generally true, but it's only true on some issues. And in this case,
you could argue that the Bush people are going to the Supreme Court
to preserve the right of Florida, to determine its own electors. So,
there is a kind of states' rights issue there. But they need, or at
least they once thought they needed the Supreme Court to endorse it.
So it goes both ways. 
<TURN>
What are the justices likely looking for? 
<TURN>
Well, I don't know. But I think that - and I think they will be
divided, I mean I don't think they will be unanimous. Obviously,
they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the
case. American election laws are often challenged at the local level
and sometimes in the Federal courts, but this is certainly <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the first
time we have had a Supreme Court challenge over presidential
election</TIMEX2>. So, there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least
law that hasn't been made yet. It's possible that if the court
accepts the invitation of the Bush campaign, at least as it is
expressed in the briefs they submitted <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2>, that the court
will in the sense, take the entire issue, even - not just the
specific questions that it was asked <TIMEX2 val="2000-W47" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> and try to resolve
the question. For example, if the court says it is clearly the fact
that the legislature of the state of Florida can determine for
itself who its electors will be, that will pretty much end the case,
because that's what the legislature already plans to do. And that
doesn't mean the Gore people won't keep trying, because ultimately
Congress has to decide and only Congress can decide if there are
competing slates of electors submitted, which slate to accept. 
<TURN>
The Johns Hopkins University constitutional law professor Joe
O'Grossman says, it's still not certain the Supreme Court will
actually hear the Florida case. As their first order, business
Friday, attorneys for Vice President Gore will move to have the
court dismiss the case brought by Republican George W Bush.
