From BBC News in London, I am Gregor Cragy for The World. The US
Supreme Court has held a hearing to decide whether to intervene in
the dispute over the presidential election results. Judith Spencer
reports on the legal wrangling that is underway.

Inside the stately Supreme Court building, lawyers for Republican
George W. Bush and Democrat AL Gore argued over the validity of hand
re-counts in the crucial state of Florida, just as Ruth Bater
Ginsburg pressed Bush's lawyer to explain why the Federal High Court
should intervene in the Florida Supreme Court's move to extend the
deadline for finishing the re-counts.

The legislature had very clearly said, you know, <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="after when?">7 days after</TIMEX2>,
<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that</TIMEX2>'s <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="what is?">the date</TIMEX2> and it just does look like very dramatic change made
by the Florida court. 
<TURN>
The US Supreme Court could rule on the matter as early as <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2>.
For The World, I am Judith Spencer in Washington.

Meanwhile, the Florida Supreme Court has rejected an emergency
appeal from Al Gore for an immediate re-count of thousands of
disputed ballots from Palm Beach and Miami Dade counties.
