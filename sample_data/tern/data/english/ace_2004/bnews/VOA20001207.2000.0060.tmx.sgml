I'm David Coler, VOA News. Three Florida courts are weighing cases
that could signally end in the <TIMEX2 val="P1M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-12" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">month-long</TIMEX2> battle for the White
House. Decisions were expected swiftly with the <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 12th</TIMEX2>
deadline for Florida to certify its 25 electors, the people who will
actually choose the next US President. <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, lawyers for Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W Bush were subjected to
intense grilling in a Florida Supreme Court hearing on the
Democratic candidate's appeal of the rejection of his request for a
recount. His chief lawyer David Boyz says whatever the court
decides, the state's deadline will be met.

I think that what they have consistently said is that they expect
this to be over by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 12th</TIMEX2>. We believe it can be over by
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 12th</TIMEX2>. And if they come out with an order that says we are
not going to count any ballots, that's going to resolve by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December
12th</TIMEX2>. If they come out with an order that says we are going to count
the ballots, we're going to start <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-07T20:01:00.60" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, we believe that can be
resolved by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 12th</TIMEX2>.

At <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the same time</TIMEX2>, the Bush legal team made its final arguments in a
challenge by Democratic voters who want thousands of absentee
ballots thrown out. If the challenge succeeds, it could more than
reverse the Texas Governor's 537-vote lead.
