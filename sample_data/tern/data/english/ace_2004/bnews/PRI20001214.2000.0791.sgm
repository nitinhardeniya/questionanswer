I am Richard Myron in Jerusalem. The victory of George W Bush has
created great interest here, and there is concern among some. Israel
is the largest recipient of the American overseas aid and President
Clinton's administration was rated by many Israelis as the
friendliest American government ever towards the Jewish State. Many
here believe that Al Gore would continue the tone of that
relationship. Barry Rubin of Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv has
studied American-Israeli relations. He believes that the Bush
administration could harm America's relationship with Israel and the
superpower's influence in the region as a whole. 
<TURN>
I think it is worse for Israel and it is worst for moderate Arab
States, because what you need most of all is not partisanship, but
competence and George W Bush is not a proven commodity and that is
the central question about George W Bush's ability to deal with the
Middle East. 
<TURN>
George W Bush's father had a difficult relationship with Israel when
he was President. Some here believe that the new administration's
ties with Israel may also be tested especially during this period of
instability. Middle East expert Barry Rubin, says that a close
military relationship between Washington and Jerusalem could suffer. 
<TURN>
In terms of things like the willingness to deliver advanced
computers, joint maneuvers, the delivery rate of various weapon
systems, all these things can slow down if relations are cold and
this could happen. 
<TURN>
By contrast, Palestinians appear to be pleased with the prospect of
the new President. Arab officials often said they felt President
Clinton's administration favored Israel during the peace process.
Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi says Bush's victory may redress
the balance. 
<TURN>
Israel and the pro Israeli lobbies have solidly supported the
Gore-Lieberman ticket. That does not mean that the converse is true.
We were willing to deal with either administration with either
party, but at the same time what we are looking for in the US is a
new and improved and more responsible approach to foreign policy and
to peace making which would not be governed by the narrow self
interest of a few individuals within the peace team. 
<TURN>
The United States has important interests in the Middle East and has
played an essential role in the peace process. The new
administration will be watched keenly here to see how it stands up
to the tests imposed by the turbulent events in the Middle East. For
the World, this is Richard Myron in Jerusalem.
