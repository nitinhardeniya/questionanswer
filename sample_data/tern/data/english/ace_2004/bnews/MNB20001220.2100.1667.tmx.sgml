our report on this <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> from kevin tibbles.

volcano exploding spewing rock and red-hot lava. the fourth largest
mountain in north american, nearly 18,000 feet high, erupting <TIMEX2 val="2000-W51" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this

especially dangerous volcano because it of its steep slopes. it
could potentially wipe out everything its path. 40,000 people live
in the path. here at the national natural disaster prevention
center, they are working around the clock. it is here they take the
volcano's pulse, calling it unstable, saying popo is simply
recharging, getting ready to erupt again.

it's acquiring more pressure. and eventually this pressure will be

the danger? the heat from popo's lava flow is melting the flashiers

mud slides.

it's like concrete coming down instead of water. so, they will

the mexican government is taking no chances. it sent out 1,000
troops to force an evacuation inside an eight-mile radius. <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>,
20,000 people in shelters, but another 20,000 refuse to leave,
worried about their corn harvests who -- or who would feed their
animals. if a major danger was to come, says this man, then we've
got to run. there's no other choice. scientists say popo has a huge
crater about half a mile across, about 300 feet deep and a lava dome
is building up like an upside down grapefruit. in contrast, mt.
saint helen had a dome, almost as if it was pregnant. randy white,
who has done on site studies of this mountain, monitors the rhythms.

it is blowing in its own way. it could get bigger. we don't know how

relationship with popo, believing the volcano is a god, showering
their crops with rain. <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, they fear it will turn vengeful,
