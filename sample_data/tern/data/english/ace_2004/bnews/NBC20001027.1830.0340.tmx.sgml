as we heard from david gregory, one of governor bush's main themes
in <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-27" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">these last days of the campaign</TIMEX2> is getting riof partisan gridlock
in washington. which was exactly what the president was talking
about <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> -- an attempt to reopen debate on a $240 billion tax cut
plan, saying the version house republicans passed is unacceptable.
because it is unfair, according to the president, to children and
seniors. 
<TURN>
instead of meeting us on common ground, instead of working with the
white house or congressional democrats, the republican leadership
closed its doors to compromise -- literally closed the doors to
compromise. they crafted their own partisan tax package and passed
it <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-26TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last night</TIMEX2> on a party-line vote. 
<TURN>
republican leaders for their part said reopening the tax debate is
not <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-27T18:35:40.81" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> realistic and the tax cut bill is probably tombed. they are
angry that the president is threatening to veto it saysing it's
wrong to have political budget battles right before the election.
