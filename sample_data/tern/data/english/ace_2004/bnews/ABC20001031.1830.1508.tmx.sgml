final think <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="T-ERROR (at least I am not sure what they mean by 'final think evening'. Sounds like a transcription error.)">evening</TIMEX2> -- on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this halloween</TIMEX2>, witchcraft. at least
500,000 americans now describe themselves as witches, in that they
practice witchcraft in one part of the country or another. many find
what pitches do inoffensive. but not so in part of louisiana. peggy
wehmeyer reports on what is acceptable in new orleans is anything
but not far away. 
<TURN>
what it comes to spirituality, new orleans is a city of contrasts.
attend mass on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-7TMO" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">sunday morning</TIMEX2>, visit fortune telers and voodoo
queens by <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-7T12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">noon</TIMEX2>. but practices that go mostly unnoticed in new
orleans are causing a stir because 70 miles down the road in a
conservative bayou town, a home to more than 100 chuhes and a coven
of witches. 
<TURN>
the main belief in witchcraft is harm none. 
<TURN>
not everyone in town thinks these witches are harmless. many fear
they are introducing dangerous spirits into the community. 
<TURN>
the church isgainst everything we stand for as a christian nation.
we want to stand up a say no in our community. we want to say
absolutely not. 
<TURN>
in an effort to end witchcraft, a resident filed a complaint against
the witches using an old law that forbids fortune-telling. the
witches believe that through these rituals and the reeged of tarot
cards, their gods and goddesses will direct <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">their futures</TIMEX2>. local
officials sent a detective to the covent to photograph the evidence. 
<TURN>
all of a sudden, we get a knock on the door. he says, i'm going to
turn these pictures into my superiors and they're going to determine
if it is fortune telling. if it is, i'll arrest you. 
<TURN>
the aclu is trying to abolish that throat. the group is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-31T18:55:08.13" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> suing
louisiana on behalf of the witches to abolish the <TIMEX2 val="1928" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1928</TIMEX2> law it
considers unconstitutional. 
<TURN>
we don't protect the wicked free speech right, then the bap titsance
catholics' free speech right is at risk. 
<TURN>
they say they don't have a kiss against the pitches but they fear
the witch-hunt will continue until the fortune-telling law is off
the book for good. peggy wehmeyer, louisiana.
