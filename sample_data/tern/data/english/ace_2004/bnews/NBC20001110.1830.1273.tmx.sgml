at $141 million, mostly private doe flagss, the monument will
feature pillars that form an open circle. gold stars will
commemorate the 400,000 americans killed in the war. but <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-10T18:51:13.12" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">these days</TIMEX2>,
nothing in washington comes easy. the planning alone for this
memorial has lasted longer than it took to win world war ii. and
now, the monument itself is caught up in controversy. not whether to
build it, but where. 
<TURN>
it's <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the right time</TIMEX2>. it's the wrong site. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
a small group of protesters has filed a lawsuit to move the memorial
off the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-10T18:51:13.12" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2> sight.

we do not want our legacy to be a controversy.

other vets however, like <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-10T18:51:13.12" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> senater bob dole, say it's not only

i don't -- there wouldn't be any sight.

but the controversy sounds all too familiar. partisan bickering,
public protests, even lawsuits. 
<TURN>
that's what america is all about. and it's why america <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-10T18:51:13.21" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> remembers
