said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2> the unemployment rate remained at the <TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">30-year</TIMEX2> low of

lower mortgage rates <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2> helped construction firms add 34,000
jobs. the huge services sector added 99,000. but growth in
manufacturing was unchanged, suggesting sluggish demand for factory
labor. that as <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">october</TIMEX2> payrolls picked up. far fewer jobs than
expected and <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">september</TIMEX2>'s payroll gains were revised sharply lower.
so far <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, the pace of job growth is slowing -- averaging
182,000 jobs <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a month</TIMEX2>, versus 229,000 for <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">all of last year</TIMEX2>.

one key measure of inflation picked up slightly <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2> above
market expectations. average <TIMEX2 val="TXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">hourly</TIMEX2> earnings <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-04T09:14:43.41" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> up 3.8% <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">year</TIMEX2> over
<TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">year</TIMEX2>. some economists note that's been the trend for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last few
years</TIMEX2> and is one of the main reasons the fed remains on inflation
alert despite other signs the economy is cooling.

i think this number will certainly calm -- continue to calm the
fears of policymakers, but i think it will put off that belief that
the fed is going to lower interest rates <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-04T09:14:43.41" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">anytime</TIMEX2> soon.

meantime, the administration couldn't wait to put a positive spin on
the nation's unemployment rate, which stayed at a <TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">30-year</TIMEX2> low. 
<TURN>
we have an economy that's in balance. obviously, we continue to see
signs of moderation, but let's remember this is still the longest
and strongest boom in all of american history.

for <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-04T09:14:43.41" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, most economists see a portrait of a moderating economy,
with few signs of a dramatic slowdown. bob beard, "cnn financial
