Cornelio's Claudio Koish, according to Downbeat magazine digs into
what jazzers call the, funk and diffuses modern modalism with fresh
vigorous spine and spunk, make that The Groove. He is <TIMEX2 val="P31Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">only
31-years-old</TIMEX2>, but Cornelio's Claudio Koish's resume already include
the Grammy nomination and Internet piano dual with American jazzman
Herby Hankok, and 5 CDs as a band leader. Correspondent Moriano
Shrodder reports <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s musical closure from Koish's hometown of
Munich. 
<TURN>
Koish's love for music goes back to his early childhood, when his
mother, a professional pianist, let him play under her concert grand
while she practiced. He started piano lessons when he was 5 and
developed a profound love for the instrument. 
<TURN>
First and foremost, I am a pianist, that's for sure. I produce also
a lot of thing and I sort of have a feeling for the process in the
studio and putting things together, but basically I am a pianist and
I love the piano. 
<TURN>
What I like to do, which is a great risk, when I play solo, I just
like to go on stage and see what happens. I think it is the biggest
risk that you can take, but if you succeed, it can be so incredible
that it is worth that risk. As a solo pianist you really have the
possibility to respond to <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the moment</TIMEX2>, but solo you can really go and
play with the energy between the audience and you, and the piano,
and the room, the lights, the weather outsides, the weather within
yourself, you know how you feel. 
<TURN>
Although he often flies back to Europe for concerts and recording
sessions, New-York has been Koish's home for <TIMEX2 val="P7Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last 7 years</TIMEX2>. He
finds inspiration in the noisy streets and says the city forces him
to concentrate and imparts a kind of intense energy necessary for
his music. But Koish found the roots of his new sound in Africa. 
<TURN>
I wanted to know about the source of jazz and to go back to Africa
to find where the source for jazz was. That's why the African
influence is very heavy in my music, plus I love it. I know it's
this tribal feeling, this rhythmic thing that wants to make you
dance and it is basically that's what I want to do with my music. I
want to make them dance, I want to make them sing, I want to make
them feel, I want to make them laugh, I want to make them cry, and
touch all emotions. 
<TURN>
In Munich Koish invited the audience to dance, but most preferred to
sit and listen with a kind of focussed reverence. 
<TURN>
Especially when I see the audience in New York or in the States,
they are so much more open, so much more physical in their response.
And here it seems that the mind comes first. 
<TURN>
He calls his unique music 'Black mud sound', a mixture of world Afro
jazz, funk and pop. His first CD received a Grammy nomination. 
<TURN>
This is the 'Black mud sound.' I read a book by Eismel Reed, one of
the great African American poets and writers called "mumbo jumbo".
It is a crazy book and at one point, he says, dancing and singing
and in Egypt this rhythm was called the "Black mud sound." And when
I read it I said this is exactly what my music is. This is earthy,
being grounded, just the combination of the sound of words together.
Actually when you define it, I am always open, I am always trying to
mix things, mix water with earth and make different shades of brown
happen from light to black. 
<TURN>
Despite his formal studies, Koish regards himself as self-taught and
approaches music as an intuitive traveler, seeking its ultimate
source. He asks his audience to surrender to the music. Listen and
let the music touch some deep chord of response. For The World I am
Mariana Shrodder, in Munich. Music by German pianist Cornelio's
Claudio Koish takes us out <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. In Boston I am Lisa Mullins
inviting you to join us again <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2> for another spin of The
World.
