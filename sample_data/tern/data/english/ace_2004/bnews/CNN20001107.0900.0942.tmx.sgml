if the volatility of the stock market has you concerned about your
investments, you may want to consider something designed to be a
bill more stable. valarie morris has more.

the stock market's <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T09:15:42.84" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> volatility likely has some investors
seeking a safe haven. one way to go is a real estate investment
trust or reat. they own and operate apartment complexes and office
buildings and other properties. demand is high for space. by law,
the trust must pay out 5% of its taxable income <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">each year</TIMEX2> and that,
in turn, creates big dividends.

the group so far in <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q3" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the third quarter</TIMEX2> for those companies that have
reported have generated about 0% earnings growth. we think over <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07T09:15:42.84" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the

so far this return, returns are up more than 15%, compared to the
s&AMP;p 500's loss of nearly 3% and the nasdaq's loss of more than
15%. but while reats offer some stability in a volatile market,
there is some risk as well. 
<TURN>
you think about real estate, it's a cyclical industry. the things
that have gotten you in trouble are too much supply. demand is
relatively stable, but the ups and downs relative to supply where
what hurts you in the real estate markets.
