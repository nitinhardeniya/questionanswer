there was, of course, a team of attorneys on both sides of this ,
live network coverage over <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the weekend</TIMEX2> of this trial going on in the
courtroom in florida, and, of course, among the teams of lawyers on
the bush side, one of the leaders, ben ginsberg, one of the lawyers
who argued the case in leon county circuit court. he's with us
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, victorious in tallahassee, florida, and ben, whatever the
outcome <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, and you were on the upside, you are forced <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-04T21:14:58.97" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> to go
along with the appeals process as is the right of the gore team.
what is your reaction to the work that will cause? 
<TURN>
well, i mean, we're certainly prepared to -- to brief all the
issues. i think that the -- the circuit court judge, judge sauls
gave a very well reasoned and thorough, both legal and factual
discussion of florida law. 
<TURN>
well, let's talk about your statement <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier today</TIMEX2> that -- that the
vice president -- i guess you were asked should the vice president
concede, and you answered, the vice president should do what's best
for the united states. is that what you're trying to say? 
<TURN>
well, sure. i mean, i think that all the people involved in this
unique -- this unique situation, the first time a presidential
election in our history has been contested, brian, need to do the
right thing, and i'm sure do the right thing, as they see fit. 
<TURN>
do you think the judge there, in addition to just giving out his
ruling at the end of the court session <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, he went on beyond the
basic issues and added reason upon reason for why he turned down the
gore case. do you think his method there was to try to make this
more or less appeal proof? 
<TURN>
well, i think what he did was addressed the situation as it exists
in florida and address the contingencies that were raised in the
voluminous briefs that he had, not only from the two party
candidates involved, but also of the interveners who were in the
case. 
<TURN>
as you know, the democratic line throughout is they won't be happy
until every vote is counted, and we couldn't help but notice, should
we call it a rhetorical device you used when talking to reporters
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this afternoon</TIMEX2>, pause and listen along with us to the following
piece of videotape. 
<TURN>
those ballots have been counted not once on <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">election night</TIMEX2> but twice
in the recount and how many did you -- did you say there were? 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> inaudible </ANNOTATION>
<TURN>
10,. 750 -- if you know the exact number, doesn't that mean they've
been counted? 
<TURN>
so i don't suppose that was any accident on your part? 
<TURN>
well, they have been making this point throughout these proceedings
that these ballots have never been counted, and that is factually
not true. they have been counted on <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">election night</TIMEX2> -- they've been
counted in the recounts, and it simply happens to be not -- not the
case that those ballots have failed to be counted by anyone. 
<TURN>
ben, for better or worse, you are forced <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-04T21:14:58.97" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> to follow the gore team
as they take you on a kind of trail of appeal here. if you were
asked to predict whether this stops at the florida or u.s. supreme
court, what would your prediction be? 
<TURN>
i think it's one of those situations where i would have predicted
all, brian. i think that the decisions are not ours to make. we'll
be involved in all the legal processes obviously as long as the gore
campaign keeps them up, no matter how long that s.
