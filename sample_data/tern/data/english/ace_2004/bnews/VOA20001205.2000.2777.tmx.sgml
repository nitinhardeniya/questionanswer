Ebola virus is one of the most feared in the world. The deadly
disease periodically attacks African villages and kills up to 90% of
those infected. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-05T20:46:17.03" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>, a team of researchers led by scientists at the
National Institutes of Health in Befesta, Maryland has developed a
vaccine that prevents Ebola virus infections in monkeys. Dr. Garry
Nabal of NIH says, the experiment with the new vaccine involved
giving four monkeys the Ebola virus, then injecting them with a
placebo immunization, which has no effect. Four other monkeys were
infected with the Ebola virus DNA and then were injected with a
vaccine called Ebola-Adnia virus booster.

In the animals that received the control vaccine, i.e. the same
vectors, but not expressing the virus proteins, all of the animals
had died within <TIMEX2 val="P6D" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">six days after challenge</TIMEX2>. In contrast, the animals
who received the DNA plus the Adnia viral vector that made the viral
proteins, not only survived the challenge, but they continued to be
symptom-free for <TIMEX2 val="P6M" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">over six months</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="P6M" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the time point that they were
followed</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
Scientists must do far more research on this vaccine before a
version of it might be used to prevent the disease in humans.
