Hello again and welcome, I am David Chadwick. Israeli helicopter
gunships were pressed into service <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, as gun battles with
Palestinians erupted on the West Bank near Bethlehem and at the
border crossing into Gaza. At least five Palestinian demonstrators
and three Israeli soldiers were killed. Both sides reported many
injured. Against that bloody backdrop, there were diplomatic efforts
to call a ceasefire. But after a Washington meeting with US
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, acting Israeli foreign
minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said what's happening is not a civilian
uprising as the Palestinians claim, but a military confrontation, a
mini war, as he put it. Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat is
expected to meet separately with Mrs. Albright and UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan, <TIMEX2 val="2000-W44" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later this week</TIMEX2>. Meanwhile, in the Middle East,
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-01T21:30:33.64" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres met with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat with whom he once shared the Nobel Peace Prize.
VOA's Laurie Cassman reports there apparently was no breakthrough.

The Peres-Arafat meeting lasted for <TIMEX2 val="PT2H" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-01" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">about two hours</TIMEX2>, but neither man
had any comments on the contents of the discussions. <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Earlier in the
evening</TIMEX2> Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he was sending Mr.
Peres with a message to the Palestinian leader to end the violence
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-01T21:30:33.64" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>. For his part, Palestinian officials say Mr. Arafat wanted to
call on Mr. Peres to get the Israelis to stop the fighting. The
meeting took place after <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">an afternoon</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">evening of fierce clashes
between the Israeli military and Palestinians in several West Bank
towns and Gaza</TIMEX2>. Three Israeli soldiers and at least half a dozen
Palestinians including one policeman were killed in separate
clashes. After an emergency meeting with his security advisors
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-01TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday night</TIMEX2>, Prime Minister Barak warned of a tough response if
the violence continues. The army will act firmly, he says, but
without being drawn into adventurism. Palestinian media says it has
been warned to evacuate its broadcasting facility. radio says
military commanders have provided Mr. Barak with a list of targets.
But his word of caution against what he calls adventurism indicates
heightened Israeli sensitivity to international accusations of an
exaggerated use of force against the Palestinians. Chief Palestinian
negotiator Sayeb Erekat says he was prevented by Israeli security
from leaving his home in Jericho because of the fighting there.
Israeli combat helicopters are reported to have hit a hotel and
casino in Jericho and a building of the Palestinian authority. Mr.
Erekat is due to travel to Washington to meet with US Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and other US officials attempting to win a
ceasefire. Mrs. Albright has already met with Israel's acting
foreign minister. Laurie Cassman, VOA News, Jerusalem.

Amnesty International says Israel's military tactics exhibit a
pattern of gross human rights violations that could constitute war
crimes. A London-based human rights organizations says Israel's use
of tanks and helicopters is far out of proportion to the threat
posed by Palestinian stone throwers. Amnesty also criticized
Palestinians for attacking Israeli civilians and said the
Palestinian authority is not doing enough to keep children away.
