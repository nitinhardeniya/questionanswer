A Chinese cancer patient has become something of a celebrity. After
doctors told Lu Yo Ching in <TIMEX2 val="2000-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2> that he had <TIMEX2 val="P3M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-08" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">three months</TIMEX2> to live,
Lu began writing a diary on the Internet. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-04T20:24:48.87" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="2000-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">five months later</TIMEX2>, Lu
has survived to see his cyber diary published as a book. As the
BBC's Dunkin Humet reports, some Chinese readers are grateful for
Lu's writings but other find them offensive. 
<TURN>
In the private ward of a Shanghai Hospital Shu Mu Yeng is a perfect
host, offering her visitors tea and chatting calmly. In the next
room her husband Lu Yo Ching lies sleeping in the final stages of
cancer, exhausted both by the battle with the disease and by <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">months
of painful writing which have brought him both fame and criticism</TIMEX2>.
Shu Mu Yeng says he originally began his controversial diary at a
purely personal concerns. 
<TURN>
Before he put it on the Internet he started writing at home for our
daughter. As his illness developed he realized that in <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-04T20:24:48.87" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the future</TIMEX2>
our daughter might lack the guidance of a father. So I encouraged
him to write something to leave for her. 
<TURN>
But as he wrote the <TIMEX2 val="P37Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">37-year-old</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-04T20:24:48.87" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Literature student, melon
salesman, advertising executive and real estate manager decided he
had feelings he wished to share with Chinese society at large. He
sought out a local Web Site, which agreed to publish sections of his
writings on the Internet. Diary of Death, as it became known,
affected many with its outspoken views, particularly Mr. Lu's
reflections on <TIMEX2 val="P6Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">6 years as a cancer sufferer in China</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
From <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the moment you pick up a lab report stating that the doctor has
diagnosed cancerous cells</TIMEX2>, life starts to get tough. If you're an
official your career will stop dead. The Personnel Department will
start looking for your successor and people will start positioning
themselves to replace you. If you're a businessperson your credit
will suddenly be devalued, even husbands or wives will start making
calculations about <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-04T20:24:48.87" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the future</TIMEX2>. And if Chinese people's attitude to
cancer is a tragedy, writes Lu Yo Ching, the treatment of cancer
patients in the medical system is like a black farce, high in cost
but often ineffective. He compares the country's overcrowded cancer
wards to a conveyor belt where the surgeons are skilled because they
have so much practice that bribes are often necessary to get quick
treatment. Lu Yo Chings criticisms and his decision <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this
year</TIMEX2> to stop taking medication and stay out of hospital for as long
as possible have provoked widespread debate.

His wife Shu Mu Yeng sighs as she describes the 10,000 e-mail
messages in their in-box. Many have been supportive and admiring but
by no means all. According to Inzer, an editor with a Shanghai based
web-site many people feel that it's not appropriate for a dying man
to go so public with his views on his illness. 
<TURN>
In Chinese people's idea we have a tradition like we don't talk to
anybody about family things, especially some kind of unfortunate
thing for lots of old people it's very shocking. 
<TURN>
Lu Yo Ching has freely admitted that he'd be pleased if the book
version of his diary earns some money to support his wife and
daughter. Yet his real interest is to provoke debate on life and how
to live it. 
<TURN>
Life when you're sick tastes bitter. But it can also be fun if
you're lucky enough to master secrets on how to turn the bitter into
fun. Avoid all household chores. This is the common objective of the
Women's Liberation Movement and the Men's Epiphany Movement in
China. Always think about spending money but never think about
earning it. Never get into a quarrel with your family where you feel
like you are the police and they are the common people. Enjoy a
fresh fruit in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="this is an interesting one">all four seasons</TIMEX2> and fresh flowers everywhere. You
don't need to dress too properly. Attractiveness lies in being a
mess. Never worry whether the battery will run out on your mobile
phone. And people will remember you if you do good things by chance. 
<TURN>
Despite all the criticism and the media spotlight Lu Yo Ching's wife
Shu MuYeng says she believes that his decision to write the diary
was a good thing. 
<TURN>
<TURN>
Lots of people think that my husband's actions could have a lot of
negative consequences. But I say, 'Long live understanding.' At
least it has made people think about life. And that was my husband's
highest aim.
