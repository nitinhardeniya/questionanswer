Meanwhile, 200 people from North and South Korea are taking part in
the second round of family reunions. The story from VOA's Alicia
Reu.

As in <TIMEX2 val="2000-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2>, communist North Korea is allowing 100 relatives to
travel to South Korea's capital Seoul to visit loved ones they have
not seen for <TIMEX2 val="P5DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">five decades</TIMEX2>. One hundred South Koreans will be in the
northern capital Pyongyang, to meet their North Korean relatives.
But South Korean officials say media interest for the upcoming event
has dropped substantially. The government has also cut back on cost
and allotted <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">days</TIMEX2> for the reunions. Officials say they have reduced
the reunion schedule from <TIMEX2 val="P4D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">four days</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="P3D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">three</TIMEX2> and will spend some
$800,000 to bring the families together, compared to the nearly $1.6
million it spent for the <TIMEX2 val="2000-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2> event. Nevertheless, the reunions
represent one of the most tangible signs of thawing between the two
cold war enemies. The North and South Korean leaders agreed to the
reunions as part of a broader reconciliation policy at an
unprecedented summit in <TIMEX2 val="2000-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June</TIMEX2>. Alicia Reu, VOA News, Hong Kong.
