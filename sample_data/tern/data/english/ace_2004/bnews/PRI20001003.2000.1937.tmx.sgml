More torrential rain in Southern Vietnam is hampering relief efforts
for thousands of flood victims. Many of them are stranded amid
scenes of desolation. More than 200 people have died, most of them
children. Owen Benajones reports.

A significant proportion of the Mekong delta is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-03T20:32:17.10" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> under water. In
upstream areas near the border with Cambodia, the water level is
declining but it's doing so very slowly, partly because of the new
torrential rains. And as the water moves downstream towards the sea,
the flood is spreading ever wider, and in some places getting still
deeper. The authorities have started building sandbag walls to
protect the main road into Vietnam's commercial capital, Ho Chi Min
city. The Red Cross estimates that as things stand, around 50,000
families are in need of assistance. Owen Benajones, BBC News, Hanoi.
