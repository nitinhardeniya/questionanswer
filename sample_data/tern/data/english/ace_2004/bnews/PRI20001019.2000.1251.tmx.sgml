This is the World, I am Lisa Mullins. There are mounting allegations
of police and military brutality in Zimbabwe. But President Robert
Mugabe has deployed troops to quell rioting over the rising price of
food. There are sharp increases here just as Zimbabwe has slumped
into its worst economic crisis since becoming independent in <TIMEX2 val="1980" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1980</TIMEX2>.
In <TIMEX2 val="P3D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">three days of unrest</TIMEX2> army helicopters have dropped teargas in
poor suburbs of the capital Harare. But many of those protesting say
they won't stop until Mugabe, the man they blame for the country's
economic problems, surrenders the presidency. From Harare the BBC's
Grant Ferrett reports. 
<TURN>
Protestors in one of Harare's poor southern townships run for cover
as riot police fire teargas from the top of an armored vehicle. Such
confrontations have been taking place all over the south of the
capital for <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">several days</TIMEX2>. The aim is two fold, to demand a halt to
the rising prices of basics such as food, fuel and transport, as
well as the resignation of President Mugabe. 
<TURN>
People are demonstrating for the price increase fuel and everything.
They are trying to stay away. They don't want to go to work.. They
want to stay away. 
<TURN>
So what happened here, can you tell me ? 
<TURN>
We set a barricade, not for our people but for the police, we don't
want them, we want them to go. 
<TURN>
And what have the police done? 
<TURN>
They are rounding up people to clear our barricade, forcing them,
beating them, throwing teargas canisters into school children, but
the war here has just started.

<TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nearly four months after Zimbabwe's bloodiest parliamentary
elections</TIMEX2>, the economy has gone from bad to worse. President
Mugabe's vitriolic attacks on the west combined with continuing
lawlessness, particularly on white owned commercial farms have
driven away donors, investors and tourists. Zimbabwe <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:20:51.55" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> has
Africa's fastest shrinking economy. 
<TURN>
Many of us like to characterize Zimbabwe's crisis as an economic
crisis but it is wider and deeper than economy. 
<TURN>
Simba Makoni looks and sounds like an opposition politician. In
fact, he is the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:20:51.55" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> appointed finance minister. 
<TURN>
You can see the price of bread go up, you can see your bus fares go
up, you can see companies closing down or working <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">short weeks</TIMEX2> and
that sort of thing. But you can also read Zimbabwe's crisis in the
number of destitute people on the streets, in the number of crimes
being committed. 
<TURN>
245! 245!

Zimbabwe earns the bulk of its hard currency here on the tobacco
auction floors. <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This year</TIMEX2>'s crop is down because of the continuing
occupation of white owned farms. When the selling season ends <TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next
month</TIMEX2>, foreign exchange reserves, hardly estimated to cover just <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a
few days of imports</TIMEX2>, are likely to completely dry up. Without them,
paying for central imports such as fuel and electricity will become
even more difficult. 
<TURN>
What we have <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:20:51.55" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2> is a political crisis and until that
political crisis is resolved, there is no way the economy is going
to improve. 
<TURN>
The sentiments of economists Howard Setoli are widely shared. With
<TIMEX2 val="P18M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">eighteen months to go until scheduled presidential elections</TIMEX2>,
Zimbabwe is headed for complete economic ruin. 
<TURN>
If government continues on its current path, the economy will
continue to contract. <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This year</TIMEX2> it was expected to contract by 8%,
<TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2> we see a further contraction of 12%. So we are talking of
massive unemployment, severe foreign exchange shortage. It is an
alarming prediction. 
<TURN>
For those taking part in the protests on the streets, after <TIMEX2 val="P2DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="could be interpreted as a point expressing, referring to this decase">two
decades in office</TIMEX2> they want President Mugabe to go <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:20:51.55" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
We want a new President. The situation is like Yugoslavia <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T20:20:51.55" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
We don't want Mugabe. No more. 
<TURN>
For The World, I am Grant Ferrett, in Harare.
