gregg jarrett, they did get a unanimous court for this decision. 
<TURN>
absolutely. brian. it was a very stern, very direct and it left no
question, i think, in the minds of anybody that this court
unanimously believes that certification should include the man
recount. and that is a clear victory for vice president al gore. the
language here, really leaves no doubt. the right of the people to
cast their vote. the court said, is paramount. the amended
certifications must be accepted by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">november 26</TIMEX2>. the reason they are
picking <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that particular day</TIMEX2> is it allows, brian, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">enough time for the
agrieved party, the losing party to file within <TIMEX2 val="P10D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-26" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">10 days</TIMEX2> a contest of
the certification</TIMEX2> and that still allows <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">enough time for the contest
to be litigated through the courts primarily the circuit court and
back to the supreme court if necessary</TIMEX2> and still meet the <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">december
12</TIMEX2> deadline for the electoral college vote here. 
<TURN>
now, greg, the only question that mean means anything at <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-21T21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this hour</TIMEX2>,
we know their view is the hand counts should now be included. will
it put al gore over the top in the race to match and exceed the
votes of george w. bush? 
<TURN>
it very well could. although, i must say that the gore campaign has
been somewhat disappointed by the number of votes they have not
received thus far in the counties that are undertaking the manual
recounts, brian. but a lot of hand counts still must be tallied. we
are also including the undervotes of 10,000 in palm beach and junt
votes of 10,000 in miami-dade as well. keep in mind, those were not
registered by the computers because they either had a hanging chad
or dimpled chad. those must be gone over by hand by each respective
canvassing board. so there are a lot of votes remaining there. this
is a gore campaign to the white house. 
<TURN>
greg, just a logistic question, how long is it going take you to get
the opinion run to you from the building behind you? 
<TURN>
i would say we should have it here in <TIMEX2 val="PT5M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-21T21:46" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next five minutes</TIMEX2>. it
depends how quickly the line moves. we have two producers, i
believe, near the front of the line. it how quickly they get handed.
it reversed the two orders of the earlier trial court, circuit court
judge terry lewis. the bottom line, this court rules unanimously the
right of the people to have the votes counted is pair month, thus,
the amended sertfi occasions to include the hand counts must be
accepted by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">november 26</TIMEX2>. in fact, it seemed to have some language
here, in fact, brian i do have it handed to me <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-21T21:46:41.06" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>. let me take a
the brian, if for some reason the secretary of state wouldn't accept
by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 26th</TIMEX2>, the certification, it could be certified elsewhere. 
<TURN>
gregg jarrett, i should point out, he is a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-21T21:46:41.06" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> lawyer himself and
so can help put this into english. greg, go ahead. if you come to a
passage we should hear. 
<TURN>
i'm flipping through the summary of enacts because that is not
important. the summary of facts. you flag us when you come to the
first portion we should hear allowed.
