<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-25T18:36:09.45" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> mr. gore. he was campaigning in his home state of tennessee
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. tennessee is not giving its favorite son a free ride. here is
abc's jim wooten. 
<TURN>
not a bad place to be from. and not a bad place to come back to.
7777 and although he hasn't been here in <TIMEX2 val="P2.5M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-25" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">2 1/2 months</TIMEX2>, the vice
president's here <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> -- 
<TURN>
it's great to be home in tennessee. 
<TURN>
back where he's run and won 14 times in <TIMEX2 val="P24Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">24 years</TIMEX2>, but where <TIMEX2 val="2000-W43" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
week</TIMEX2> he's dead even or maybe even trailing governor bush, who isn't
in trouble at home, and who just happened to be in tennessee <TIMEX2 val="2000-W43" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
week</TIMEX2>, too, asking his favorite sarcastic question -- "where exactly
is home for the vice president?" 
<TURN>
he may win washington, d.c., but he isn't going to carry tennessee! 
<TURN>
that has considerable resonance here. 
<TURN>
i think he's been in washington too long. i don't thinpeople
consider him a tennessean anymore. 
<TURN>
gerald wiser voted for bush <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2>. this is one of a few states
with early voting. 
<TURN>
you have nine people running for president. 
<TURN>
and so did the wrights, michael and carolyn. independents, but not
undecided. 
<TURN>
the biggest negative for . gore is his association with mr. clinton. 
<TURN>
the baggage? it's not an example of a prophet without honor in his
own land or even here in his own hometown. it's just that tennessee
is a genuine two-party state and has been for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a long, long time</TIMEX2>. and
although gore has never lost an election here, he's never had a
landslide either. and this time, little by little, his
once-comfortable ad has been whittled down. his state campaign
director insists, "we expected that." 
<TURN>
you've got a republican governor, two republican senators, the
majority of the membership of congress are republicans. they'd like
nothing better than for them to embarrass him in his own home state. 
<TURN>
so, tennessee's most illustrious modern political family is having
to work mighty hard at home <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-25T18:36:09.45" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> and spend at least $1 million on
local tv ads something they didn't plan on. 
<TURN>
can you come out and work hard for him one more time? 
<TURN>
the importance of tennessee to my family goes way beyond its 11
electoral votes. 
<TURN>
sure, it's a matter of pride, but in a race this narrow, 11
electoral votes ain't hay. jim wooten, abc news, nashville.
