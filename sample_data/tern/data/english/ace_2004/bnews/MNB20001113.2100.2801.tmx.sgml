and we continue <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-13TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> to try to measure just how this story is
playing overseas as we'll be doing <TIMEX2 val="2000-W46-XTNI" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">each night <TIMEX2 val="2000-W46" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">all week</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-13TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, the
anchor of the israeli network <TIMEX2 val="TEV" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">evening</TIMEX2> newscast on channel 2
jerusalem jacob elon on what israelis are thinking and saying about
america's long wait for a president elect. 
<TURN>
frankly, we are shocked here. we are used to the israeli political
system, always tied and always tied up. and <TIMEX2 val="TNI" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">election nights</TIMEX2> here too
close to call more often than not. but what you're experiencing over
there is really inconceivable to israelis. they spend <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a lot of air
time</TIMEX2> here trying to convey the electoral system to my viewers here.
and the election action i got was basically hey, this is
undemocratic. this is the greatest democracy we're talking about.
and the system is undemocratic. and the turnout as well i felt's
over 90% here usually. and it's hard for israeli citizens to grasp
50%. since we're talking about israeli reel and the middle east,
it's not, you know, the major headline <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2>, but it certainly
was a major story. on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the election day</TIMEX2>, we had <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">hours</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">hours of
broadcast</TIMEX2> here live, same as in the states. and we've been following
this story, of course, <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2>. but here as usual, i might say, we
have news of our own. actually <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, we just had four israelis
killed in three serate terrorist acts. the peace forces don't like
uncertainty. i would say even less than the stock market. and things
here are getting worse <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">day</TIMEX2> by <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">day</TIMEX2>. israel is usually looking up to
the president of the united states for some help. some israelis at
least, if not most of them, are still hoping that president clinton
might be able to intervene and help in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the short time he has left</TIMEX2>.
but the more things are complicated and uncertain back there in the
states, i think more and more israelis are worried that there's
nobody to turn toment -- to. and i think what happened in <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-13" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past
few days</TIMEX2> among israelis here is a new perception that maybe things
in the united states are not as perfect as they might have thought.
actually, they're far from being perfect, and they are sounding and
looking to us here more and more like what we know from our own
political system.

that insight <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-13TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> from jay sob eilon, the anchorman israel's
channel 2 network news. he took <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time out from covering the death of
lea rabin, widow of yitzhak rabin</TIMEX2>. she died <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2> of cancer at
the age of 72.
