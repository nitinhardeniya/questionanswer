<TIMEX2 val="TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">good evening</TIMEX2>. that call to order you just heard reverberates through
the supreme court <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day that the justices convene</TIMEX2>. but <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> was
no everyday session. never before has the united states supreme
court taken up a case that could decide a presidential election. it
did <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. that session of the supreme court and two defeats for al
gore in florida courts dominate the news <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. we start with the
u.s. supreme court, specifically at issue, an appeal from the
campaign of george w. bush that the florida supreme court had
exceeded its authority when it ruled florida counties could have
<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">more time to hand count ballots</TIMEX2>. throughout <TIMEX2 val="PT1.5H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-01" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">an hour and a half of
argument</TIMEX2>, the justices were aggressive in peppering lawyers with
questions. and they seemed interested on two issues. was there a
federal issue involved that would even require the u.s. supreme
court to rule? and if so, did the florida supreme court improperly
rewrite florida law, as governor bush contends? a sure sign of the
historic nature of <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2>'s proceeding, for the first time ever,
the court immediately released an audiotape of the arguments. but in
the courtroom, listening in person was abc's jackie judd. 
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-01T18:30:29.16" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">even now</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-01TXX" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">hours after that hearing ended</TIMEX2>, there are still protesters
circling the supreme court. as boisterous as the protesters were,
nothing intruded on the ritual inside. 
<TURN>
the chief justice and the associate justices of the supreme court of
the united states. 
<TURN>
the courtroom was packed. al gore's top campaign aides, his
children, republican senators and congressmen, they were all there. 
<TURN>
god save the united states and this honorable court. 
<TURN>
first up, ted olson lawyer for george w. bush, laying out the
campaign's main claim. 
<TURN>
olson made it through only <TIMEX2 val="PT56S" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-01" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">56 seconds of his arguments</TIMEX2> before a
justice broke in. 
<TURN>
well, mr. olson -- 
<TURN>
sandra day o'connor, often the swing vote on this court, demanded to
know why the court even had a role in this case. 
<TURN>
olson argued that a <TIMEX2 val="P1CE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">century-old</TIMEX2> federal statute prevents laws
governing an election from being created after the fact which, he
claimed, is just what the florida court did. and also, that the u.s.
constitution gives state legislatures, not the courts, the right to
choose electors. 
<TURN>
of all the justices it was ruth bader ginsburg who seemed most
sympathetic to the florida supreme court. 
<TURN>
midway through the hearing, chief justice rehnquist seemed to scold
his colleagues for being too talkative when he made an unusual offer
to the lawyer representing florida's attorney general. 
<TURN>
and so it went on. laurence tribe, gore's attorney, said the state
court did nothing illegal. it simply provided a way for a close
election to be examined. 
<TURN>
justice o'connor again, but this time suggesting the state court had
overstepped its authority and perhaps there was a federal case here. 
<TURN>
justice antonin scalia also pressed tribe. he said the state court
relied on the florida constitution to draft its decision, excluding
state lawmakers and that violated the u.s. constitution. 
<TURN>
it was just breyer who asked the most straightforward question of
all. what happens if the court rules in favor of bush? 
<TURN>
the answer from the secretary of state's lawyer was, bush wins and
all the litigation in florida ends. not everyone agrees. they say
that no matter which way the court rules, it will not provide nearly
so much finality to this presidential election. charlie? jackie judd
at the supreme court. our thanks.
