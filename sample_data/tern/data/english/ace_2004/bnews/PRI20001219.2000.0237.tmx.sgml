1.26 billion, still the largest in the world. But the paper says
that if it weren't for the one child policy that figure would be 300

daunting challenge coping with the net <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> increase of 10 million
people over <TIMEX2 val="P1DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="it makes more sense to start a decade in a year rather than a decade">the next decade</TIMEX2>. At the same time, it says, China will
