Documented. From NPR news in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. A
Florida State judge has ordered local election officials to ship
thousands of ballots to the state capital. The move comes as the
judge decides whether to order a recount of those ballots in the
presidential election. NPR's Steve Inski was in the courtroom.
Steve, what are the issues that came up in this hearing <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>? 
<TURN>
Corey judge N. Sander Sauls is deciding whether to order a recount
as you said of those ballots, 9000 or more actually from Miami Dade
County that apparently were never counted at all, at least according
to the Democrats in the presidential election and about 3300 ballots
from Palm Beach County that were considered by local officials but
then thrown out, disallowed. Judge Sauls is deciding whether to
count those ballots and go through them and perhaps add some votes
to Al Gore's final total, which is exactly what the Democrats want.
He is not ready to do that yet. He did not agree to the Democratic
proposal to begin counting <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow morning</TIMEX2> but he has ordered that
the ballots be shipped up. <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Later this week</TIMEX2>, Miami Police apparently
are going to escort them upto Tallahassee and they will be ready to
be counted if the judge decides at <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W48" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">a later time</TIMEX2> to do so. 
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-28T20:00:55.42" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> is a big consideration from here. What's the judge's
timetable? 
<TURN>
Not as fast as the Democrats would like, not as slowly as
Republicans would prefer. He is going to order a major hearing on
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> to review all the legal and evidentiary issues, look at
evidence, perhaps hear from witnesses and after that the judge will
decide if there are any ballots to count. It might take <TIMEX2 val="P5D" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-02" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">another five
days or so</TIMEX2> to do it. Neither side seemed particularly pleased by the
timetable but the judge said, well, I am going to make everybody
equally unhappy. 
<TURN>
Thank you. NPR's Steven Inksi reporting from Tallahassee, Florida.
As the battle over votes goes on in Florida, Washington State is in
the middle of recounting the votes cast in its very tight US Senate
race. Jennifer Nesan reports from member station KPLU in Seattle. 
<TURN>
The recount of the votes cast for Democrat Maria Catwell and
Republican Senator Slate Gordon is calm and organized. The State's
Elections Director Garry Macintosh says the process is about as
exciting as watching paint dry. 
<TURN>
There are a lot of things about the election's process I think that
are fairly complex. This isn't probably one of them. 
<TURN>
Catwell leads Republican incumbent Slate Gordon by fewer then 2000
votes. At this point neither of the candidates plan to contest any
of the votes. State law requires a recount when the margin of
victory is less than one half of 1 percent. The recount is expected
to be completed by <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of the week</TIMEX2>. No statewide recount in
Washington has ever changed the initial outcome. For NPR news, I'm
Jennifer Nesan in Seattle.
