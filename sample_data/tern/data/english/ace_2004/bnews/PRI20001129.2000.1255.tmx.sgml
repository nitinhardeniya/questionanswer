This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins. The United States is the
heavyweight champion of the world when it comes to the Internet. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:20:55.88" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>
based on <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:20:55.88" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">past</TIMEX2> experience, you'd think the main challenger for the
crown would be Japan. Well, you would be wrong. When it comes to the
Internet, Japan could have been a contender. <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This week</TIMEX2> in Tokyo, a
blue ribbon advisory panel wrapped up proposals aimed at turning
Japan into an information technology powerhouse by <TIMEX2 val="2005" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2005</TIMEX2>. We asked
The World's Lucy Craft to find out how fast the Japanese will have
to drive to catch up to the Americans on the information
superhighway. 
<TURN>
By all appearances, Japan would seem a natural candidate to be the
next Internet superpower. At this <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> technology trade show in
Tokyo, for example, NTT Docomell, Japan's biggest cell phone maker
touted its latest model. By <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2> callers will be able to see as
well as hear each other, thanks to the addition of a tiny video
monitor. The country that gave the world VCRs, the Walkman and video
games continues to churn out entertainment related devices. One of
this <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Christmas</TIMEX2> season's hottest items is this. A consumer version of
a DJ's night club turntable, complete with simulated scraps, sounds
and effects buttons. Whether it is cell phones, digital cameras or
flat TV screens, Japan continues to dominate many sectors of
technology and its manufacturing expertise is still world-class. And
yet, it's something of a paradox but after <TIMEX2 val="P1DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">a decade of explosive
Internet growth around the world</TIMEX2>, only one in five Japanese goes
online. 
<TURN>
It is very difficult to rationally explain why because visibly it
doesn't make sense. 
<TURN>
Lee Daniels is President of Jupiter Telecommunications, Japan's
largest cable operator. 
<TURN>
You would think that companies are so knowledgeable, so educated, so
technically literate that they would be at the forefront of the
development. 
<TURN>
Internet access fees here run as much as 10 times as high as in the
West, thanks to a near monopoly held by NTT, the politically
powerful <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:20:55.88" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> state owned telephone company. Though its sky high
rates are why Japanese don't go on line as much as citizens
elsewhere, but Jupiter Chief, Daniels says it all comes down to
conservative, conformist, consensus lobbying Japanese society itself
that's impeding growth of the Internet here. 
<TURN>
I think it really reverts back in to these traditional values, the
way Japanese are educated and basically individualism is not
encouraged and neither school setting or corporate setting. And the
people who are really making a difference in the United States are
individuals who are entrepreneurs, they will come up with an idea,
take the risk and lead. They are not afraid to go against normal
traditional ways of doing things and taking personal risk. And in
Japan you don't see that risk factor as evident as what you would
find in the United States. 
<TURN>
Which partly explains why Japanese political leaders such as Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori are in a fix. Well, desperate to escape the
economic stagnation that has mired this country for <TIMEX2 val="P1DE" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">over a decade</TIMEX2>,
they also worry that traditional ways of life would be swept aside
by the Internet with dotcom jobs replacing life long employment
security, e-commerce endangering business built on personal
relationships. 
<TURN>
They hate to see some of the traditional values that Japan has
always distinguished itself, starting to erode. 
<TURN>
Again, Lee Daniels. 
<TURN>
And there is a conflict that exists. As you start moving down this
path towards technical innovation, it invites disruption or it
brings about the conflict much quicker than I think most people
would be prepared to start dealing with it. I think there is a lot
of issues that Japan is starting to question, how do they adapt, how
do they change, how do they preserve what is good about their
society while making these changes to be more competitive with
what's happening throughout the rest of the world. 
<TURN>
In a crisis, such as right after World War II, Japan has proven
adept at rapid change, but in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:20:55.88" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the past</TIMEX2> drastic reform has always
been masterminded from above by Japanese bureaucrats. A true
Internet connected society and economy won't emerge, say experts,
without a grassroot's led revolution. And that would be a first with
this <TIMEX2 val="P2000Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">2000-year-old</TIMEX2> country. For The World, I am Lucy Craft in Tokyo.
