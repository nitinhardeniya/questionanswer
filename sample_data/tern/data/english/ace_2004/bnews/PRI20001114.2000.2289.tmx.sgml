Neither candidate will be declared the President elect until <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-17" mod="ON_OR_AFTER" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">at
least Friday</TIMEX2>. That's when the overseas ballots will be counted and
factored into the candidate final totals. The World's Jennifer Glass
reports from London.

There are Floridians all over the world. Because abroad aren't
counted in our census, no one knows how many, and no one knows how
many voted. Those who did it like Margaret Sawn, an American working
in Costa Rica, says she is glad <TIMEX2 val="2000-WXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a week and a half before Americans
in the United States went to the polls</TIMEX2> that she cast her absentee
ballot for George Bush. 
<TURN>
Well, because, you know, Gore was going after the outer voters very
hard, I did feel <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> would be important, and, of course I didn't
think, it would get down to this but who wouldn't.

Here in London, Frances Deek is a retired teacher who lived in
Britain for <TIMEX2 val="P18Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">18 years</TIMEX2>. She says she cast her absentee ballot for Al
Gore. Deek says in <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-14" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent days</TIMEX2>, she has had to defend the United
States political system. Britains who notice she is American, have
let her know what they think of the elections.

They keep saying, "Oh, isn't that terrible. The biggest democracy in
the world and it's all falling apart. And I say it is because we are
a democracy that it's happening this way, it's because everybody
gets the vote. It's because people will not let things slide. They
want to know everything. This is part of being a democracy. 
<TURN>
But for Americans abroad, says Geek, participating in democracy
voting is more work then Americans in the United States. 
<TURN>
You have to make a very conscious effort and it takes mailing two
things to get to vote. You have to send in your card to start with,
and then when you get the ballot bag, you have to send the ballot
back. So, its harder than if you were just wandered up to your poll
on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Election Day</TIMEX2> and voted because you have been registered for
<TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="generic">years</TIMEX2>.

In the Israeli town of Ramad Beithshamuz, Karen London originally
from Hollywood, Florida, says she and her husband almost didn't
vote. Her ballot arrived late. Her husband said voting was a waste
of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2>. But she insisted and mailed their ballots. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-14T20:38:09.83" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> London says
she is glad she didn't listen to her husband and so is he.

I didn't anything of it and so when my grandson called <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-08TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="must be the previous Wednesday">Wednesday
morning</TIMEX2> to say, 'Wake up, <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> your vote is going to count', then
it was really a matter of, you know, our vote not only does it count
like it shows in any election, but it really counts in the final and
we voted an absentee ballot. 
<TURN>
But Londons didn't say which way they voted but they have cast
ballots in each of the three Presidential elections held since they
moved to Israel <TIMEX2 val="1991" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">9 years ago</TIMEX2>. <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This year</TIMEX2>, says Karen, has been special
and a little frightening. 
<TURN>
It's quite a daunting feeling to think that, you know, of hundreds
and millions of people, you know, in this case our vote counts,
although it doesn't count more than any other citizen's vote, in
this particular moment it counts more than everybody elses, because
that's what are waiting for.

Major Mikiang, a Floridian based in Germany is from Okichobee
county, Florida. He says despite the waiting, the court cases and
the uncertainty, he is not worried that there'll be a constitutional
crisis in the United States. 
<TURN>
I don't really have any concerns at all. I am very confident that
our form of government that checks and balances the way we set the
process up and the way it is moving, so many things to fall back on
to keep the process moving, that I am not really concerned at all.

One radio announcer here in London made an accurate and insightful
comment <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. At a <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time like this with the Presidency hanging in
the balance</TIMEX2>, in many nations the generals have moved in. In America
the lawyers do. For the World, I am Jennifer Glass in London.
