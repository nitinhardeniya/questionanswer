One other Major League baseball manager is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-10T21:20:05.96" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> looking for a new
team to lead. The Toronto Blue Jay's have decided not to renew the
contract of Jim Firgossy after the team placed third in the American
League Eastern division for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two straight seasons</TIMEX2>. Toronto finished
with the mediocre 83 and 79 record and Firgossy's contract expired
at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of the season</TIMEX2>. Before the Blue Jay's announcement <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>
Firgossy said that he felt that he would not be asked to return.
General Manager Gord Ash says he felt the team needed a different
manager to become a playoff contender. 
<TURN>
I think our club over <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last two years</TIMEX2> made some progress, but
it's <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a time</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-10T21:20:05.96" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> to get to the next level and my intuition along with
those of us in our baseball cabinet. We do make these decisions in a
organizational faction and the organization felt that we would be
best served by making a change. 
<TURN>
Firgossy is the sixth manager to be fired since <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2> ended. He
says he is not interested in another position with the Toronto
organization, but he would like to remain in baseball.
