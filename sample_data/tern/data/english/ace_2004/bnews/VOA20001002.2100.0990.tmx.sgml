It's <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-02T21:16:30.10" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> to look at professional soccer and Rugby and how it
can be bad for a player's health. This is according to two British
medical studies, as we hear <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-02T21:16:30.10" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> from VOA's David McClary, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">lifetime</TIMEX2>
injuries are common and in the case of Rugby, increasing.

A study of nearly 300 <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-02T21:16:30.10" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> British professional soccer players
finds that nearly half have suffered the chronic joint disease
"osteoarthritis" often as early as age 40. Most have the disease in
two or more joints. Nearly one third of those surveyed had surgery
at least once since retiring, mostly on knees with knee replacement
a common option. The Coventry University researchers who report the
findings in the British journal of sports medicine say anxiety and
depression are common among those so injured, possibly as a result
of pain and impaired mobility. A second study in the same journal
finds that injuries among Rugby union players have nearly doubled
since the sport became professional <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">five years ago</TIMEX2>, from 27% to 47%.
The Scottish researchers say one possible explanation is the use of
padded equipment. They suggest it gives a false sense of security
causing more aggressive play. David McClary, VOA News, Washington.
