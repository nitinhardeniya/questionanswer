we realize that many of the people joining us here <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-09TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> for this
broadcast are doing so to try to get more information. these are
<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">uncertain times</TIMEX2>. the nation has yet to election elect a
president-elect. it's something mike barnicle said earlier on our
air <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> that caught our eyes and ears and we'd like mike to come
back here live. you were talking about this country, how it felt to
be an american <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>.

yeah, brian. there is a sense of i think increasing despondency in
the country as we continue on this. <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tuesday night</TIMEX2> was <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the longest
night</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">it</TIMEX2>'s turning into perhaps <TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the longest month</TIMEX2>. people are
depressed enough about politics. there's probably reason why these
two candidates split this vote so evenly down the middle. neither
one mag managed to ignite the hopes and dreams of americans. in
"u.s.a. today" there is a ma'am of the vote on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tuesday</TIMEX2>, the red for
bush, blue for gore. county by county assessment of how the vote
went on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tuesday</TIMEX2> and it's sort of looking at the nation in terms of
wal-mart versus martha stewart. people who believe in school player,
gay marriage, people who drive ford explorers and who drive volvo
station wagons. there are these splits in the country ands with as
we increasingly head toward litigation in terms of who the next
president of of the united states is going to be, more and more
people are becoming more depressed about the process. it gives them
a sense of what they have felt for too long <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-09T21:43:24.05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, that politics is
just name-callers, increased partisanship, special prosecutors,
reliance on lawyers and things that don't affect the ordinary
person, that all that has <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">now</TIMEX2> mushroomed into something called the
presidency of the united states and how we elect a president. the
fact that as we continue on this road and continue to talk about
what's going to happen in florida, the judges have really already
spoken on this, the ultimate judges, the people. their decision is
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-09T21:43:24.05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> being reviewed. accurately, i think, and what more people are
seem to be saying to me is that they want an accurate recount. they
want a legitimate recount, an announcement of it, they want a winner
declared and they want a transition to begin. nbc they on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tuesday</TIMEX2>.
they want a winner. mike barnicle, "new york daily news." thank you
for coming on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-09TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> and repeating that for us.
