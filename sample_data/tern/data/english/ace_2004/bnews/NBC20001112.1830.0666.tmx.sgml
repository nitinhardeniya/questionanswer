al gore continued to refuse comment on the erecognize torl battle in
florida, leaving it to his point men, william daley and warren
christopher to defend the controversial hand recounts <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-12T18:41:06.44" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> under way. 
<TURN>
this is the procedure called for by florida law. florida law
provides for an opportunity for hand counts to check machine counts. 
<TURN>
christopher said the recounts should be completed within <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-12" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">a matter of
days</TIMEX2> and at <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-12" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">that point</TIMEX2>, gore campaign sources contend, gore will be
in the lead in florida and on track to win the election. meanwhile,
governor george bush spent <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2> out of public view, behind the
gate of his ranch in texas, while his point man, james baker
appeared on five network talk shows arguing vigorously that the hand
recounts are improper and should be stopped. 
<TURN>
this opens up tremendous possibilities for human error and indeed it
opens up tremendous possibilities for something worse than human
error, and for mischief. 
<TURN>
bush advisers say if they lose that argument in court <TIMEX2 val="2000-W46" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> they
may appeal. and if they lose florida, they may ask for recounts in
other states, where the filing deadline has not yet passed and where
the vote is close, including iowa and wisconsin. states that could
help them win, even without florida. there could also be a recount
in new mexico, where the race is a virtual tie. new mexico state
police there have impounded ballots in some counties to make sure no
one tampers with them before any possible recount. the gore team is
also still considering other options, including going to court if
the hand recount does not give them the lead in florida, so while
both sides say they want to move as expeditiously as possible, both
are considering strategies that could cause this fight to drag on
for <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W46" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">weeks</TIMEX2>. chip reid, nbc news, washington.
