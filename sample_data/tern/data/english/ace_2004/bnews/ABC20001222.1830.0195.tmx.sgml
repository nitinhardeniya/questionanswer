from every part of the country, and many other parts of the world.
people are trying to reach their people somewhere else. new york's
la guardia airport has been a nightmare <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, but there is some
good news. even with the bad weather and the number of people
flying, the industry says 2 million in the u.s. alone, things are
not as bad as they might be. here's abc's bob jamieson. 
<TURN>
reporter: at chicago's o'hare airport, ground zero for air travel
troubles <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">all year</TIMEX2> -- there was a <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">holiday</TIMEX2> surprise. 220,000
passengers jammed the airport, but with good weather and labor peace
at united airlines, there were few delays. 
<TURN>
we're actually on time <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. a rare thing that happens here. 
<TURN>
reporter: there were scattered delays in philadelphia, new york and
boston. snow fell <TIMEX2 val="P1D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-22" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">all day long</TIMEX2> in the northeast, causing poor
visibility, but little stayed on the ground. across the country,
skies were clear at almost every major airline hub and little change
is expected <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2>. which was particularly welcome at atlanta's
hartsfield airport. <TIMEX2 val="2000-W51" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this week</TIMEX2>, bad weather added to a labor
dispute between delta airlines and its pilots caused scores of
cancellations and hundreds of delays. still, delta said it was
forced to cancel 5% of its flights <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, because some pilots
refused overtime. 
<TURN>
this journey started at <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-22T06:45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">6:45 a.m.</TIMEX2>, and it doesn't look like there's
any promise of getting out of here <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-22TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
reporter: analysts say travelers should still consider <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> an

surprise. this is not at all the way things usually are. 
<TURN>
reporter: which may explain why so many, almost 45 million people,
are traveling by car <TIMEX2 val="2000-W51-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this weekend</TIMEX2>, up sharply from <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>. and
few problems are reported. 
<TURN>
all aboard.

reporter: amtrak is expected to have more passengers too. 
<TURN>
i take the train because it's a lot more sane than flying. 
<TURN>
reporter: the rail carrier is adding 16,000 seats in the northeast
alone. many for passengers who decided not to take a chance on the
weather or the airlines. bob jamieson, abc news, new york. we all
