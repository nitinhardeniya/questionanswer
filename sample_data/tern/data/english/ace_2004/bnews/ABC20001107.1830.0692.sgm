let's go to cokie roberts. you've got one projection, and there may
be a sort of indication for us if nothing else? 
<TURN>
we actually have a couple now, peter. the house of representatives,
same thing. you've got 223 republicans republican seats now, 210
democratic seats. the democrats need to pick up seven to win. they
already have picked up win of those, so it's really only six. that
doesn't sound very hard, but it is hard, and they were hoping in
kentucky, where the polls have already closed to pick off a couple
of incumbents, and it looks like that's going to be very hard to do.
anne northrup, incumbent there, appears to be beating eleanor
jordan, the democratic nominee. and in the sixth district of
kentucky, a rematch, ernie fletcher, the incouple bantd republican,
seems to be beating scottie baseler, the democrat who had the seat a
couple of years ago. guns a huge issue in that campaign. the
national rifle association spent a lot of money. it seems to have
paid off. the democrats hopes of picking up early seats seem to be
thwarted. look to florida wre they have a bunch more at stake.
