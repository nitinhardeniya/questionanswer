we're going to take "a closer look" at the man who will be
inaugurated <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2>. he won the election. he has a clear and
powerful mandate for change. he will be the president of mexico,
vincente fox. this is an enormous event for mexico which has been
ruled for <TIMEX2 val="P7DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">seven decades</TIMEX2> by the same party. it's a very important new
chapter for mexican-american relations, because mr. fox is promising
revolutionary change. abc's sam donaldson has <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-30T18:45:59.84" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> been to
mexico to see him. 
<TURN>
the <TIMEX2 val="P58Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">58-year-old</TIMEX2> man who becomes president of mexico <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2>,
strikingly handsome, wily in the ways of modern politics, enormously
appealing as a symbol of change, has big plans. 
<TURN>
i dream about so many things that we can do. eradicating poverty,
eradicating crime, violence, corruption. i believe in people. i
believe in the fact that people can change themselves. 
<TURN>
mexicans were voting for change on <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">election day</TIMEX2>, no doubt about it.
but it is also clear mexicans were voting for a man who has charmed
and fascinated them, who has become their political messiah. fox
comes from a farming and ranching family. his grandfather was an
irishman. but as a young man, fox left the fields to work for the
coca-cola company in mexico city. 
<TURN>
i started as a route salesman working for the company. <TIMEX2 val="1964" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">ten years
later</TIMEX2>, i was the president of the company. how do you get to be
president of a company in <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1964" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">ten years</TIMEX2> when you start at the age of 22? 
<TURN>
working hard, working hard, man. 
<TURN>
but it will clearly take much more than hard work to make changes
that will affect not only mexico but the united states. he says he
will drive out the drug traffickers. he promised to reduce poverty,
which could mean an open border with the united states since fewer
mexicans would want to cross over for jobs. he's even promised to
stamp out corruption. 
<TURN>
corruption is the evil of all evils. 
<TURN>
when you were campaigning, you called the opposition, the pri,
"blood suckers," "black adders," "leaches." do you mean that? 
<TURN>
i am inviting them to govern with them together. 
<TURN>
but why should they help you? you beat them. you destroyed their
power base. 
<TURN>
well, i'm sure in their heart they still love mexico. 
<TURN>
many people here believe fox is naive. 
<TURN>
the danger is probably he cannot deliver the promises that he made
during the campaign. 
<TURN>
javier trevino was the campaign manager for the ruling party
candidate fox beat. if these frustrations occur, what do you think
vincente fox will do? 
<TURN>
nobody knows, exactly, because nobody knows vincente fox as
president. 
<TURN>
many of them say to me, "fox is naive. he's not going to be able to
do it, and he may go off half cocked." 
<TURN>
well, those who have not been able to do things for <TIMEX2 val="P71Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">71 years</TIMEX2> are not
the best advice i can get. i know we mexicans can. 
<TURN>
optimistic and ha charging, fox takes office <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2> acting like a
man who, indeed, believes he can defy the odds and make his dreams
for mexico come true. sam donaldson, abc news, on horseback in
