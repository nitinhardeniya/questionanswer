lots of people go out for a jog to keep fit. lots more of us should.
but one man is taking that activity to new extremes. ben bradley of
chicago affiliate cltv has the story. 
<TURN>

rick ran the chicago marathon <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">sunday</TIMEX2>, but that was just a warm-up. a
warm-up for a run around the world. 
<TURN>
to kind of go after any goal, you have to be able to envision it.
you have to be able to see it. you have to be able to break it apart
and put it back together. horn honks 
<TURN>
with applause and well wishes from family and friends, rick is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-24T14:25:30.71" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>

university of illinois in chicago is making him the subject of a
human endurance test, first to see if it is physically possible to
run around the globe, then to see how the body holds up. 
<TURN>
it comes with a price. you now, obviously the training's been
difficult. and you kind of trade in the usual and customary life,
you know, for the strange and unusual. 
<TURN>
rick plans on running about 30 to 50 miles <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day</TIMEX2>, 1,000 miles <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a
month</TIMEX2>. at that rate, it'll take him <TIMEX2 val="P18M" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about 18 months</TIMEX2> to get around
the world. 
<TURN>
i'm scared. i'm nervous. i pray a lot. cheers and applause 
<TURN>
rick also has the prayers of the students and staff at nazareth
academy. it's where he went to high school, and it was his first
rest stop. 
<TURN>
i can't say enough about healthy lifestyles, healthy choices.

<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-24T14:25:30.71" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, he is back on the road. running towards his goal of doing
something no person has done before. 
<TURN>
it's just kind of like feeling like a -- like an explorer or
something. you get a chance to experience the world in a different
kind of way.
