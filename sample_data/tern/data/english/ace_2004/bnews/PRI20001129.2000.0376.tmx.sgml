This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins. Both George W. Bush and Al
Gore <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> continue to press their cases literally and figuratively.
Their PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly. Governor Bush's
running made Dick Cheney talk with reporters about the Republican
transition plans, another signal that Bush is getting ready to
become the next President of the United States. Meanwhile, Vice
President Gore continued his appeal for patience while he contests
Bush's claim to victory. And attorneys for both men were preparing
for key court battles <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later in the week</TIMEX2>, which could settle the
<TIMEX2 val="P3W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W48" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">three-week</TIMEX2> dispute over who won Florida and the presidency. The
World's Clark Boyd has the latest. 
<TURN>
All eyes were on Florida yet again <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> as lawyers, judges,
lawmakers and citizens, all picked at the knots that have tied up
the conclusion of this presidential election for <TIMEX2 val="P3W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W48" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past three
weeks</TIMEX2>. <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Yesterday</TIMEX2> in Leon County Circuit Court, Judge N. Sander Sauls
set a <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered
the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and Palm Beach
counties, not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth,
to be brought to Tallahassee under police escort. <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Today</TIMEX2>, as
officials in both two counties ready the ballots for transport,
George W. Bush's lawyers asked the Judge to order all 1.16 million
ballots from the two counties to be trucked to the state capital.
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29TAF" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Late this afternoon</TIMEX2>, Judge Sauls granted that motion. In Washington,
Vice President Al Gore was back on television <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this morning</TIMEX2> trying to
shore up public support for his legal cause. In a taped interview,
for NBC's Today Show, Gore said despite all the legal maneuvering he
is calling on both camps to put partisan politics aside. 
<TURN>
I think that both Governor Bush and I should recognize an obligation
during <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:06:16.81" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">this time when the votes are still to be counted</TIMEX2>, to try to
restrain the passions of our partisan supporters. 
<TURN>
Meanwhile, Bush's vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy
man <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. After a heart checkup at a Washington hospital he
appeared at a news conference to say that he is pressing ahead with
transition plans. 
<TURN>
We have now acquired office space in McClain, Virginia that will
become the site for the transition operation that we announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two
days ago</TIMEX2>. So we are just in a business of getting up and running,
but we <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:06:16.81" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> have an office with a lot of space, we have got people
signing up, volunteers coming on, telephones being put in and
computers. So we will be fully operational within <TIMEX2 val="P1D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next day</TIMEX2> or
<TIMEX2 val="P2D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">two</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Earlier today</TIMEX2> in Florida, the Republican dominated legislature began
hearings on calling a special session to pick the states electors
itself, should the <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 12th</TIMEX2> deadline still find the election
tied up in the courts. The Committee heard from angry voters and
precinct workers in Palm Beach. 
<TURN>
I believe our issues do relate directly to the appointing of
electors for the state of Florida. The electors need to be
appointed, are supposed to be appointed according to the will of the
people and I believe in Palm Beach County that it was very difficult
to determine what the will of the people was. 
<TURN>
Although Al Gore said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> that he certainly feels like he won the
election, he put his odds of wining the various legal battles at
fifty-fifty. Gore said, if Bush does triumph in court, he will throw
his support behind the Republican president elect. But for <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:06:16.81" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, says
<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:06:16.81" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche, both
sides are positive that they've won the election. And says Riche,
the longer the fight goes on, the more troublesome <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next four
years</TIMEX2> might be. 
<TURN>
What we risk by prolonging this is greater public cynicism and a
hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to
work together. After all, come <TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January</TIMEX2>, these people are going to
have to be in Washington whether Gore or Bush is the President. You
have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work
together with the new President and with each other. So we don't
want to prolong this forever. 
<TURN>
The US Supreme Court will hear arguments from both sides on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>
and Florida's Leon County Circuit Court will consider the arguments
on disputed state ballots on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>. And while the nation varies
of the protracted legal battle may be Leon County Circuit court
Judge N. Sander Sauls said it best. The whole process, he said, is a
bit like being nibbled to death by a duck. For The World, this is
Clark Boyd.
