if they are telling the truth. we begin <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-03TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> with the huge
federal surplus. both al gore and george w. bush have different

patti and gary thompson of new jersey prefer al gore's plan to pay
off the nation's $3.5 half dollar national debt. keep the good times
rolling.

employment is very high <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-03T18:42:35.10" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2>, and we have good jobs.

but both candidates' economic plans cost a fortune. and the question
is, will there be enough money? what's the truth? are bush and gore
making campaign promises they can't possibly keep? the nonpartisan
center on budget and policy priorities did an exhaustive study of
the surplus. the authors' conclusion? beware of smoke and mirrors
from both candidates. 
<TURN>
i would have some skepticism toward both plans. they're ing overly
optimistic in what they can actually deliver. 
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> reporter: </ANNOTATION>
both gore and bush rely on predictions from the congressional budget
office that the government will take in $4.5 trillion more than it
spends over <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next ten years</TIMEX2>. about half that surplus is for
social security, leaving $2.2 trillion for tax cuts and new
government programs. sounds good, but many economists say that's
hugely optimistic because of economic assumptions by both candidates
that won't necessarily pan out. for example, government spending is
assumed by the candidates to rise only at the rate of inflation.
while, in truth, analysts say it's been rising 20% faster than that.
both candidates also assume strong economic growth resulting in that
huge surplus. the truth? if the economy takes a major hit, more than
just a mild recession, experts say you can subtract $1 trillion from
the surplus. "business week" magazine puts it bluntly -- "newsday"
calls their promises "pie in the sky." "the new york times" says
they're "unrealistically optimistic." analysts warning the thompsons
of new jersey, the williamses of texas and america's 80 million
other voters. when the numbers are in trillions, with promises to
match, keep your hand on your wallet. mike jensen, nbc news, new
york.
