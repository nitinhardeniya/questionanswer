From NPR News in Washington, I am Corey Flintoff. President Clinton
charged Republicans today with having closed the door to compromise
on a spending bill. He says he will veto a House passed package that
combines a minimum wage increase with tax cuts. Republicans defended
their actions today. NPR's Brian Naylor reports. 
<TURN>
It's not what the Republican leaders wanted in the days leading up
to the election, a messy veto confrontation with the president, but
it's looking increasingly like that's with they are getting.
President Clinton renewed his threat to veto a tax cut package and a
38 billion-dollar spending bill, which the Senate passed this
afternoon. Lawmakers will work over the weekend on the remaining
spending bill funding many labor, health and education programs.
House Appropriations Committee Chairman, C.W. Bill Young expressed
some exasperation on the House floor today with the administration.

If they can't have it their way, they don't want it anyway. So,
wait,wait.

In the meantime, Congress will be forced to vote Saturday and Sunday
on one-day temporary funding bills to keep the government
functioning. Brain Naler, NPR News, the Capital.
