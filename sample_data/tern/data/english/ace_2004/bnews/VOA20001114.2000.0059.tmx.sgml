I'm David Coler VOA News. Florida has announced the official results
of <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last Tuesday</TIMEX2>'s presidential election. Florida Secretary of State,
Katherine Harris said that out of 6 million votes cast Republican
candidate George W. Bush received just 300 votes more than
Democratic candidate Al Gore. Ms. Harris also said that in obedience
to a court ruling she will consider amending the results based on
hand recounts in three Florida counties. 
<TURN>
In accordance with <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s court ruling confirming my discretion in
these matters, I'm requiring a written statement of the facts and
circumstances that would cause these counties to believe that a
change should be made before the final certification of the
statewide vote. This written statement is due in our office by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15T14:00" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2
p.m. tomorrow</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
At stake are Florida's 25 electoral votes. Whoever wins them will
become the next US President.
