in <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2>'s ruling from florida supreme's court, the chief
justice warned recounting undervotes in the counties would cause
"confusion and disorder." in some places <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> those words appeared
prophetic. mike von fremd from jacksonville.

when the supreme court issued its decision to stop, observers in the
counting room were told to leave. 
<TURN>
are you serious? 
<TURN>
as soon as i see it in writing, if it says stop, i will stop. we're
stopping <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-09T18:36:00.97" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2> until i see if we need to keep on stopping. 
<TURN>
the process stopped before a single ballot was counted. tempers
flared early on after the republican chairman of the canvassing
board announced in advance that it was impossible to meet <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2>'s
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">p.m.</TIMEX2> deadline. 
<TURN>
no possible way.

if he cannot carry out his constitutional duty to do this, then he
should do as the judge in tallahassee did, recuse himself. put
somebody there who can get it done! cheers and applause 
<TURN>
the problem is that the 5,000 undercount ballots are mixed in with
the pool of nearly 300,000 ballots. they flew in a computer
consultant to install a program to separate the ballots. his
explanation of how it all works baffled me. 
<TURN>
we load the cards into the reader hopper at which time the machine
looks for a light and then passes into the stacker. 
<TURN>
from beginning to end, both sides fought every step of the way. <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-09TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
morning</TIMEX2> they could not decide how to begin. <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-09TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, the two sides
are arguing about what to do <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-09T18:36:00.97" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now that they have been told to stop</TIMEX2>.
democrats say, at least sort the ballots. republicans said, no way.
