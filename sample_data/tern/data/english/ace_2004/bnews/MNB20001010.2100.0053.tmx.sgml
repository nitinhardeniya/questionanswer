<TIMEX2 val="TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">good evening</TIMEX2>. the front pa of <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow morning</TIMEX2>'s wall street post,
we'll report that for the first time since before the democratic
convention, george w. bush has grabbed the lead in the race for
president. here's what they're basing it on. the newest "washington
post"/abc news poll showing a 50%, 46% race. much closer, however
nrk our own tracking poll, a statistical dead heat at 43%, 42%. but
the trend line is clear. over <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-10" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past several days</TIMEX2>, gore's loss is
quite literally bush's gain. so the stakes could tpwhot higher.

with jim lehrer, both candidates will face off for <TIMEX2 val="PT90M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-11TNI" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">90 minutes</TIMEX2> with
americans listening for closely at home so. we begin <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-10TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> with a
new leader in some of these polls, texas governor george w. bush.
nbc news correspondent david gregory is traveling with him. 
<TURN>
bush in tennessee <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> where the race on the home turf is
surprisingly tight, announcing the endorsement of prominent
democrats including griffen bell, and taunting gore who <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this
year</TIMEX2> was accused by a tenant of failing to properly maintain rental
property he owns in the state. 
<TURN>
tennessee is a fine place to live, i guess it depends, though, on
who your landlord is. 
<TURN>
both sides have gone negative. but advisors say bush will avoid
getting personally involved for fear of a backlash, leaving his top
aides to attack gore by calling him a serial exadge ray tor. a
bigger worry to some advisors is it's bush himself giving gore room
to attack his readiness to be president. over <TIMEX2 val="2000-W40-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the weekend</TIMEX2> in
florida, bush offers a tangled description of his tax plan and has
to turn to his brother to ask if the numbers add up. 
<TURN>
i was trying to do some fuzzy math. 
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="2000-W40" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late last week</TIMEX2>, a labored attempt to give an undecided voter a
reason to support him. 
<TURN>
i'm groping for the right answer, as you can tell. i'm weaving
around. you tell your friend that i think i've got the capacity to
reach across the partisan line. 
<TURN>
advisors maintain such gaffes are hardly decisive that the election
will turn on a general comfort level that undecided voters have with
both candidates, terrain where they believe bush still has an
advantage. david gregory, nbc news, with the bush campaign in
