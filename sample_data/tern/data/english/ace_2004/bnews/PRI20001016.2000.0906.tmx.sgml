Israel is also confronting hostilities on its northern border,
hostilities the Israeli government was hoping would end when it
withdrew its troops from Southern Lebanon <TIMEX2 val="2000-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">five months ago</TIMEX2>. Hezbollah
geurillas announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-W42" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> that they have captured an Israeli man
and are holding him along with 3 Israeli soldiers they nabbed <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">9 days
ago</TIMEX2>. The Hizbullah group says that the man was spying for Israel's
intelligence service. The Israeli government insists that he is a
private businessman. The BBC's Andrew Harding is in the Lebanese
capital of Beirut. Andrew Harding how does this capture affect the
talks in Egypt? 
<TURN>
Well, it certainly is not going to help matters, but ultimately, of
course, the Hezbollah is deeply critical of the peace process, they
do not like the sort of deals that Arafat appears to be, at times,
ready to make. Though, I think that if they could stifle the entire
peace process at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T20:15:06.66" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the moment</TIMEX2>, then that is what they'd like to do. 
<TURN>
There are lot of claims and counter claims about this captured man
and what he does. What do we know for sure about him? 
<TURN>
It is very difficult to be sure at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T20:15:06.66" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the moment</TIMEX2>. Hezbollah is saying
one thing, the Israelis are saying another and when we are talking
about a possible member of the secret services of Mossad, it is very
hard for any one but the Israelis to know for sure. Clearly, this is
a man who was travelling on some other passport somewhere in Europe,
whether or not an Israeli citizen, we don't know it for sure.
Certainly Hezbollah say he is. He would appear to be back in
Lebanon, under Hezbollah guard. Beyond that, we have these two
conflicting reports from Israel and Hezbollah. I guess it's a
question of trying to choose which is the more credible, and that's
a very difficult call at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T20:15:06.66" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the moment</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
Well, whatever his identity and his aim, Hezbollah is using the
information about him as a bargaining chip, it would seem. Husain
Nebrusi of the Hezbollah Information Bureau in Beirut had this to
say <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this morning</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
We will not tell anything about the conditions of these Israeli
captured soldiers of the colonel unless we get something in return.
We are determined. This is not a breach of the Geneva Convention. I
mean, I would be saying the Israeli prisoners, they were not allowed
to even see the Red Cross as they didn't for <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="it's not clear when these three years occurred">three years</TIMEX2>. We didn't
even know the least information about them. 
<TURN>
So, Andrew, when he says that they are looking to get something in
return for information about these captured Israelis, what in
particular do they want to say? What are they hoping to achieve? 
<TURN>
Specifically, Hezbollah want 19 prisoners that are <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T20:15:06.66" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">currently</TIMEX2> being
held in Israeli jails. Many of them, as Israel admits, as bargaining
chit in this 'Hit the tag hostage war'. There are also a number of
other men believed to be in Israel from Iran and also a lot of
Palestinian detainees who may or may not come into the equation even
when this negotiating process over the fate of these hostages gets
off the ground. And it really struggles to get off the ground so far
because Hezbollah is taking such a tough line. 
<TURN>
Andrew, can you tell us about the ties between the Hezbollah and the
Palestinians, particularly in the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T20:15:06.66" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> uprising. I mean those who
have criticized the Israeli withdrawal for its troops from Southern
Lebanon <TIMEX2 val="2000-SP" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last spring</TIMEX2> have said that it showed that the armed
uprisings have won <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="borderline unmarkable">the day</TIMEX2> and forced the Israeli pullout. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T20:15:06.66" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> there
have subsequently been accusations that the Lebanese Hezbollah has
tried to influence the Palestinians toward armed revolt. Is there
any evidence of this? 
<TURN>
Well, the Hezbollah certainly would like to do that and they are, at
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T20:15:06.66" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the moment</TIMEX2>, extremely popular in the Palestinian territories because
Palestinians see Hezbollah taking a tough line at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a time when many
of them are critical of the more compromising route that Arafat
appears to be taking</TIMEX2>. There have been traditional differences
between Hezbollah and some of the more extreme groups inside the
Palestinian areas, but at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T20:15:06.66" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the moment</TIMEX2>, I think, the aim of Hezbollah
and other groups is to get over those differences, unite and form a
very strong overall group of extremist forces dedicated to
destroying the peace process as it <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T20:15:06.66" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> stands.

The BBC's Andrew Harding speaking to us from Beirut, Lebanon. Thank
you.
