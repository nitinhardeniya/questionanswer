<TIMEX2 val="2000-W40" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this</TIMEX2> was <TIMEX2 val="2000-W40" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the week that the bottom halves of the democrat and
republican tickets moved into the spotlight</TIMEX2>. nbc's anne thompson has
been tracking them both. 
<TURN>
the running mates -- dick cheney and joe lieberman. running hard as
the race for president enters <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="hard to know if they meant 4 weeks starting now, or the month of October.">its final month</TIMEX2>. some are declaring a
winner in the choice nor vice president. 
<TURN>
it's joe lieberman because he game umph to the democratic ticket. he
helped change the public's perception of al gore. 
<TURN>
the man <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-07T18:42:41.85" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">once</TIMEX2> thought a risky pick, first jewish candidate on a
national ticket, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-07T18:42:41.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> a political star. 
<TURN>
gore/lieberman, no bull, no pork. laughter 
<TURN>
humanizing the sometimes robotic gore. 
<TURN>
when al and hadassah and tipper and i are together, we call this
double dating. 
<TURN>
using an informal style to draw voters in, even when on the attack. 
<TURN>
does governor bush <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-07T18:42:41.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> want to do for america's environment what he
has done here in texas? i hope not. 
<TURN>
cheney could not be more different. the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-07T18:42:41.85" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> cabinet member and
oil industry executive so formal and business like on the campaign
trail, critics complain some appearances have all the excitement of
a defense department briefing. 
<TURN>
bill clinton and al gore have had every chance and every reason to
improve our schools, to ruce taxes, to save social security. but
they haven't even tried. 
<TURN>
the so-called safe pick quickly became the controversial one. news
reports about failing to vote in some elections and moving slowly to
answer questions about his multi-million dollar ceo retirement
package, reasons why some analysts consider him to be a flop. that's
until <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">thursday night</TIMEX2>'s debate. 
<TURN>
i think by any standard, his debate performance was very, very good.
and i put him back in the asset column now. 
<TURN>
conventional wisdom is running mates don't make a difference. in a
race this close, could cheney or lieberman sway the all-important
undecided voters? 
<TURN>
saddened to learn -- 
<TURN>
one gives substance in style. each side hoping this time it will
make a difference in a race still too close to call. anne thompson,
