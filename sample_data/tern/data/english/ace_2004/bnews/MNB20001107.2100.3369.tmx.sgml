we are joined by the reverend jesse jackson. reverend jackson, we
heard a report <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this evening</TIMEX2> that the vice president had
dispatched you, or at least invited you to help in the get out the
vote effort <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>. is that true? 
<TURN>
well, not just <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>. over <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last few months</TIMEX2> gone about 50 stops
around the country we did massive voter registration, then get out
the vote efforts. i think we were along with the naacp and others,
worked on the get your souls to the polls on the one hand and on the
other hand say stay out of the bushes and it worked. 
<TURN>
do you know anything we don't know, because so far we have a tight
race here? 
<TURN>
a tight race but fact of the matter is that jeb bush's
anti-affirmative action action in florida solidified women and
people of color and basically we won florida, thanks to jeb bush.
our vote in michigan, we have done <TIMEX2 val="P10D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">about 10 days of solid work
across michigan</TIMEX2>. workers fighting for right to organize and women
fighting for -- and blacks together. i think when bush made it clear
that he wants a strict constructionist court led by scalia, attacked
affirmative action, attack of women's rights,-point this strong
ideological line is shown in these vote totals <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> so far. 
<TURN>
reverend jackson, it's going to be said, however late we're at this
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, and whoever wins it, that it's going to be so thin, so
narrow, that it will be a victory without mandate. 
<TURN>
well, i think what it means is that we must end -- then deal with
some consensus issues. for example, should there not be a consensus
that social security should be kept secure and not risked in the
marketplace? should we not make a commitment to educate all of our
children, not just vouchers for a few of them? maybe something as
basic as comprehensive health insurance. 42 million americans have
no health insurance, 50 -- many americans die <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2> from cancer.
amounts to a vast majority of the american people. 
<TURN>
reverend jackson in florida <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> the thanks very much as always
for congress on with us.
