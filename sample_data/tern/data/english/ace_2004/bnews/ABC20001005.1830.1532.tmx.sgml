finally <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this evening</TIMEX2> -- the auctioneers. here in new york <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, the
gigantic international auction house sotheby's pleaded guilty to
price-fixing with christies -- its only real competition in an
industry that does $4 billion in business <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every year</TIMEX2>. this is a case
of the rich and the powerful stifling competition. here is abc's
aaron brown. 
<TURN>
sold for $200,000. 
<TURN>
diana brooks was at home on center stage in the toney world of
high-priced art. as president of sotheby's, she often conducted the
biggest, the highest profile auctions, like the kennedy family
treasures, herself. 
<TURN>
sold for $95,000. 
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, she took center stage in a far grittier place, pleading
guilty to bilking hundreds of wealthy art patrons out of tens of
millions of dollars. 
<TURN>
those charged engaged in classic cartel behavior -- price fixing,
pure and simple. 
<TURN>
the cartel consisted of sotheby's and christie's. arch rivals for
<TIMEX2 val="P3CE" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="20" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">nearly three centuries</TIMEX2>, the two auction houses agreed to fix prices
on what they charged the buyers and sellers of high-priced art. even
arch rivals, it seems, have a common bond. 
<TURN>
sotheby's and christie's are all about money. they are dealing with
art, history and beautiful things. but at the end of the day, people
go to sotheby's and christie's because they believe they can get
best price for them. 
<TURN>
they have already agreed to pay more than $500 million to settle the
civil suits spawned by their crimes. ms. brooks, who could go to
prison and will certainly be heavily fined has agreed to turn
state's evidence, turning against her boss. she becomes sammy "the
bull" gravano with better taste. and the art world, well, while
being more careful, perhaps, it continues to do business with the
same two companies who for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">years</TIMEX2> swindled them. 
<TURN>
i think the impact has been negligible. much to a lot of people's
surprise, business seems to be booming. consignments still seem to
be as high as they were before the scandal broke. 
<TURN>
which may be the clearest proof yet that the rich are different from
the rest of us. 
<TURN>
$1.3 million.
