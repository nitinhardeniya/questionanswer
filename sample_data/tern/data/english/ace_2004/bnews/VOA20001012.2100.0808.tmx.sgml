Here in the United States county workers in Los Angeles, California
have returned to their jobs as union negotiators continue contract
talks with local officials. VOA's Michael Sullivan reports that
workers are responding to a request from the city's Roman Catholic
ArchBishop.

More than 40,000 workers were back at their jobs <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> following
a <TIMEX2 val="P1D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-11" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">1-day</TIMEX2> walkout that closed social welfare offices and crippled
public medical services. During the work stoppage <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, local
residents were unable to register marriages or get documents for a
real estate transactions. People at one record's office found no one
on duty to help them. The return to work <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> came at the urging
of catholic cardinal Roger Mahodi who said the labor dispute was
hurting the poor who rely on public services. In response to his
plea, union officials agreed to try to resolve their differences
through negotiations. The back-to-work agreement angered some of the
strikers, however, who called the decision a sellout. The labor
dispute is over wages. Workers want a 15.5% pay raise over <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="not entirely clear if this is starting this year or not">three
years</TIMEX2>, the county has offered 9%. A separate work stoppage by Los
Angeles transit workers is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-12T21:13:28.27" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> in <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">its 27th day</TIMEX2>. That strike affects
450,000 bus and subway riders, many of them low-income workers. An
issue in that strike is a management plan to hire more <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">part-time</TIMEX2>
drivers and limit <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">overtime</TIMEX2> pay. Talks are at a standstill, but 4,000
striking drivers have promised to respond to the latest management
offer, <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="this Thursday or next?">Thursday</TIMEX2>. Mike O'Sullivan, VOA News, Los Angeles.
