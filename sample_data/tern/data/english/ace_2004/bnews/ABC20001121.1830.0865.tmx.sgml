we're going to take a closer look at one of the way in which this
unresolved election will have a consequence. the clinton
administration said it didn't think the delay would affect the
presidential transition. washington remembers how ill-prepared the
clintons were when they first came to the white house t whole point
is to have an efficient governing apparatus in place and ready to
go. 3,000 of the most important jobs are to be filled. it is
<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2>-consuming at the very least. here's abc's john martin. 
<TURN>
the government is ready. there are two floors of offices, 540 work
stations, about $700,000 worth of rented space. 
<TURN>
we will give to the head of transition for the president-elect, this
key. 
<TURN>
the general services administration has the tools, just not the
names. 
<TURN>
you see a small gold chip on it, and that tells us who you are, and
it tells us you're authorized to go in, and it opens the door. 
<TURN>
but there's not <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a lot of time</TIMEX2>. some clinton administration
appointees are leaving already. stephen preston, general counsel to
the navy, for example, is going back to his old law firm, d will
have to be replaced along with all the others. but it takes <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> for
the fbi to check newcomers' backgrounds, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> for the senate to
approve the most important 600, so they can get to work in the top
agency positions. 
<TURN>
if you don't have those filled, you basically lose the connection.
you decapitate the federal government. <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2> counts. <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2>
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-21T18:44:25.03" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2> is equal to <TIMEX2 val="2001-WXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a week next year</TIMEX2>. 
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> is especially tight for the bush team. republicans have not
held the white house for <TIMEX2 val="P8Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">eight years</TIMEX2>, so they will be starting from
scratch. 
<TURN>
c. governor bush will have empty offices everywhere, and he cannot
-- the executive cannot operate except through staff, and if he
hasn't had staff cleared on <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">inauguration day</TIMEX2>, he is really crippled. 
<TURN>
al gore has the luxury of being able to ask some clinton appointees
to stay on, but he still has <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">little time</TIMEX2> to waste. 
<TURN>
the senators are going to go through every nominee with a fine-tooth
comb. 
<TURN>
robert reich was on the <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2> clinton transition team and wound up in
the cabinet. even without a close election, it took bill clinton <TIMEX2 val="P6W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1992" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">six
weeks</TIMEX2> to make his rst appointments. and that can be a problem. 
<TURN>
the new president has to get a state of the union message ready and
prepare his first budget. all of that has to happen right away. 
<TURN>
so, the clock is ticking, except here in the transition office,
where it makes no sound. but everybody knows -- <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> is of the
essence. john martin, abc news, washington. 
<TURN>
the white house said <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> it is taking steps to make sure the
transition proceeds as efficiently as possible. abcnews.com has
details of what it takes to complete a very complex process.
