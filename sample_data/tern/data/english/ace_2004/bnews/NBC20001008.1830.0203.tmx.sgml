in washington, u.s. officials are working overtime to find some way
to defuse the volatile situation in the middle east as the two sides
attack each other. nbc's joe johns reports. 
<TURN>
secretary of state albright <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> turned up the pressure on
palestinian leader yasser arafat to stop the violence. 
<TURN>
he has been able in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T18:33:23.17" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the past</TIMEX2> to control large portions of this. we
expect him to be able to control this. 
<TURN>
israelis have long argued that arat can and should do just that. 
<TURN>
so if mr. arafat can in one single word stop the violence and get
back to the negotiations table, i think he will find readiness and
willingness on the israeli side to reach a reasonable agreement. 
<TURN>
but as protests in support of the palestinians sprang up from egypt
to morocco to iraq, arafat's advisers suggested that his power to
stop the violence may be limited. 
<TURN>
president arafat cannot give orders to a people, to a whole nation,
that is being killed <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2> and being asked to lie back and to
die quietly, not to defend themselves. 
<TURN>
the disagreement over which side should bear the greatest blame
spilled over to the united nations. a security council resolution
criticized israel. the u.s. tried to water down the measure, then
abstained from voting. the administration, hoping to de-escalate the
violence, is appealing to both sides. 
<TURN>
that requires even greater efforts on the part of the palestinian
authority to try to control the crowds, to keep them away from
israeli fixed positions and on the israeli side that would enable
them to restrain the use of live fire. 
<TURN>
aids to president clinton say he has proposed a middle east summit
in egypt as early as <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2>. aids do not rule out the possibility
of the president attending if israeli and palestinian leaders agree
to the meeting. joe johns, nbc news, the white house.
