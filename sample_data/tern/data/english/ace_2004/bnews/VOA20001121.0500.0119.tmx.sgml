at targets in the Gaza Strip, striking near the office of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Targets included a police station
and Security Headquarters. Parts of Gaza were plunged into darkness
as electricity went off during the raids. Following the strikes,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Israel would use all force
necessary with no restraints to end <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W47" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">weeks of violence</TIMEX2>. He described
the bombing of a school bus traveling from a Jewish settlement in

said no negotiations were currently underway with the Palestinian
