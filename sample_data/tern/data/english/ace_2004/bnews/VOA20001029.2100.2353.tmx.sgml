Gallup popular opinion surve, George W Bush, the Governor of Texas,
the Republican nominee, holds a 49% to 42% advantage over his
Democratic opponent Al Gore, the Vice President. But two other major
surveys gave Mr. Bush only a one-point lead. On <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, several
major newspapers weighed-in with their endorsements and VOA's Peter
Hymline has that story.

In its <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> editions, the New York Times calls Vice President
Gore, the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his
knowledge of government, his experience at the top levels of federal
and diplomatic decision making and his devotion to the general
welfare. The Times editorial says Mr. Gore has, in its words,
struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the
Clinton administration's ethical lapses. The paper's Editorial Board
goes on to say, we believe Mr. Gore would never follow Bill
Clinton's example of reckless conduct that cheapens the Presidency.
The Times also praise Republican candidate George W Bush for running
what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but the
writers said they had concluded Mr. Bush's agenda was harsh on
issues such as women's rights, guns, and law enforcement. The Times
joins the Washington Post newspaper, which earlier gave its backing
to Mr. Gore. Other major dailies throwing their support to the Vice
President <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> included the Philadelphia Inquirer, The Denver Post
and The San Jose California Mercury News. Mr. Bush also picked up
some key endorsements <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> including both major Chicago papers. In
its editorial, The Chicago Tribune called Mr. Gore a descent man but
concluded that, in its words, his penchant for enhancement has
become something of a running joke. The Tribune endorsement says
this is an election about honesty, about restoring bipartisanship,
about fostering government that will nurture a booming economy
without getting in the way of American ingenuity. The paper
concludes that there is one candidate who will do that and that is
George W Bush. The battle of the editorials reflects what many
political analysts predict will be one of the closest Presidential
races in <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">decades</TIMEX2>. Most opinion polls give Mr. Bush a slight lead but
a just released survey by Newsweek magazine puts the text. The
Newsweek poll indicates voters consider Vice President Gore the more
intelligent candidate, but they see Governor Bush as more honest.
