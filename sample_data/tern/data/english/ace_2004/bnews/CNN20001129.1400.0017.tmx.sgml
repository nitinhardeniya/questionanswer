hello, i'm kathleen kennedy, sitting in for chuck roberts. we begin
<TIMEX2 val="PT.5H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T14:00" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">this half hour</TIMEX2> with the latest developments in the presidential
election. thousands of disputed ballots in south florida are being
prepared for shipment to the state capital amid tight security. a
tallahassee judge wants them in case they are needed as evidence in
a lawsuit challenging florida's certified vote. but there are
growing signs state lawmakers could step in and decide the winner.
jonathan aiken reports. 
<TURN>
state legislators in florida's capitol are discussing if a special
session is needed to decide which 25 electors will represent florida
in the electoral college -- a democratic slate? or a republican
slate? u.s. law allows state legislatures to choose representatives
to the electoral college as a last resort. florida lawmakers may go
that route, if the disputed recount isn't settled by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">december</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="P6D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">six
days before the electoral college meets to verify the results of the
presidential election</TIMEX2>. experts are telling florida's lawmakers to
act cautiously. 
<TURN>
the right to vote is clearly protected by the first amendment. i
think that your action needs to take that into consideration. 
<TURN>
as lawmakers consider their options, the legal fight over the
recount continues at several levels. in leon county, which includes
tallahassee, circuit court judge n. sanders sauls ordered 13,000
contested ballots from miami-dade and palm beach counties to be
brought to tallahassee by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">saturday</TIMEX2>. that's when he'll decide if they
should be counted, along with contested ballots from nassau county.
miami-dade county, for one, is heavily democratic, and it's from
these areas, gore officials believe, that a hand count of ballots
will turn up enough votes to overcome governor bush's lead. in west
palm beach <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">wednesday</TIMEX2>, an independent, conservative group called
judicial watch asked a court to let it see those ballots for itself. 
<TURN>
we're here for the public, for the public should know what's going
on without two adversaries that are fighting with each other. 
<TURN>
the gore camp would prefer the ballot counting from all disputed
counties start immediately. it's concerned the public is losing
patience with the legal challenges to the florida vote. as this host
of legal actions makes its way through the florida court system,
attention is turning to the legal body of last resort in the united
states -- the u.s. supreme court in washington. oral arguments will
be heard <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">friday</TIMEX2> on a request by the bush campaign to overturn a
decision by florida's supreme court. it ruled that recounts
submitted to state officials after a filing deadline had passed had
to be counted. jonathan aiken, for cnn, washington.
