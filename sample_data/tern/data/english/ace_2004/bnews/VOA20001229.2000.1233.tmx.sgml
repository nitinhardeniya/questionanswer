We were soft after that first drop. Sometimes when it comes too easy
you can get soft but I liked the way they responded. This team has
been resilient <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="sport's year">all year</TIMEX2>, had a lot of guys down and a lot of people
had to step up and they found a way to win. I'm real proud of them.
