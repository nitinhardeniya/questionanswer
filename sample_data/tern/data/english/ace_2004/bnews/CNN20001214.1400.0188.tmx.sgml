joining us <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> to put all of this in some kind of perspective is
"cnn headline news" political analyst michele mitchell. hi, michele. 
<TURN>
hi, chuck. 
<TURN>
the cabinet, the bush cabinet do you think it will be diverse and
will he reach out to the other side of the aisle? 
<TURN>
he's saying that he will. but this may be an impossible tsk. not
because he is isn't interested in appointing democrats, but because
the word has gone out not to accept a position. now, this, of
course, is part of their tactic to try to regain control of the
house and senate in <TIMEX2 val="2002" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2002</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="2004" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2004</TIMEX2>. it may be not bush's fault if you
don't see any of the democratic faces around the table. it's not for
want on his part. 
<TURN>
so there is word among democrats not to accept a cabinet post? 
<TURN>
yes. 
<TURN>
how can they make everybody fall into line on that? 
<TURN>
it's easy, you want the campaign funds when you run in <TIMEX2 val="2002" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2002</TIMEX2>? it's
fairly easy to put pressure like that on democrats. there might be
rogue democrats who is more conservative that really doesn't care
and is in interested in serving in a cabinet post. that may be where
he finds the best luck. 
<TURN>
he's probably going to appoint two prominant african-americans, rice
and powell. any other outreach to the black community? 
<TURN>
i think those are the two main appointees and the glittering stars
in the crown. that's one of his way in reaching out to the black
community which feels more than alienated after this election if
some of the leaders are to be believed. 
<TURN>
is there a risk if he becomes a centrist, does he risk alienating
the hard right of the republican party, do you think, the tom d lays
and others? 
<TURN>
this is his big problem right away. he is a centrist and tom d lay
has already said, hey, look, i think what we did over <TIMEX2 val="P6Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last six
years</TIMEX2> in the house has been really great. this is going to be a
really big problem because the conserve tiss have sat on their
hands, saying, if we shut up, is bush going to win? the
conservatives want it push through the agenda. it's a thorn in
bush's side already. the two do not like each other. let the games
begin. 
<TURN>
all right, michele mitchell, thanks very much.
