Washington <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">9-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

American President Bill Clinton told journalists <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, that
he ruled out any risk of an economic recession happening in <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-15" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the short
term</TIMEX2> as a result of record oil prices.


Clinton said in reply to a question by a journalist on the risk of a
recession: "The answer in <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-15" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the short and mid-term</TIMEX2> is no," and said he
was following developments on the oil market closely.


He described the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to increase production to 80 thousand barrels <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">per day</TIMEX2> and
measures taken since then as "not sufficient at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2> to allow the
markets to incorporate" the new situation.


The American President said he was "leaving all possibilities open"
and stressed that he would "do his very best to lessen the negative
impact of record oil prices on American consumers."


Clinton urged Congress to renew, before the end of the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2>
congressional session in <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October</TIMEX2>, the administrative authority's
jurisdiction to resort to the use of strategic oil reserves in the
event of a crisis and to endorse the tax measures, which he suggested
<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">several years ago</TIMEX2> to no avail, to encourage cutbacks in energy
consumption and renewable energy production.
