Kuala Lumpur <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

The Asian Soccer Federation chose Saudi national team coach Nasser
al-Jawher as the best coach in <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October</TIMEX2> for his contribution to
leading the team to the finals of the Asian Nations Cup held in
Lebanon <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2>.


Al-Jawher took over the task after Czech Milan Machala was sacked as
a result of the title-holding Saudi team's 1-4 defeat in its opening
match against Japan. He succeeded in re-establishing their confidence
before they lost 0-1 to Japan in the final in spite of his obvious
control of the game, especially in the second round.


With al-Jawher's leadership, Saudi Arabia won three matches in the
Asian championship, 5-1 against Uzbekistan, 3-2 against Kuwait with a
golden goal and 2-1 against South Korea with another golden goal
while it tied negatively with Qatar with one goal and lost the final.


<TIMEX2 val="P42Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">42-year-old</TIMEX2> al-Jawher has a record studded with successes as a player
and coach. He defended his country's team colors for <TIMEX2 val="P8Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">8 years</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">5 of
<TIMEX2 val="P8Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">them</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> as al-Akhdhar's captain and played 4 Gulf championships with
them in Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

He also played in the ranks of al-Nasser for <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">20 years</TIMEX2> and captained
the club for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a long period of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> too.


Al-Jawher has played many training rounds in Germany, England, Hungry
and Malaysia and has worked alongside the best coaches in the world
of the likes of Joel Santana, Firink Boshkash, Henri Michel, Anton
Pichnik, Billy Buckingham, Willy Pilachi and Milan Machala.


He supervised al-Nasr's training and took them to the Asian Club
Heroes' final for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the <TIMEX2 val="1991" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">91</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">92</TIMEX2> season</TIMEX2> and to the finals of three local
matches.


The Best Player title went to Japanese Hiroshimi Nanami who was
chosen Best Player in the Asia Championship.


Nanami had an unsuccessful experience with Italian club Venizia
before returning to Japan <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-15" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2>. He wanted to prove himself in the
Asian Championship and succeeded in this because he was chosen Best
Player twice, against Saudi Arabia and against Uzbekistan.


Japan was chosen Best Team after it won the Asia Cup for the second
time in its history, after <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2> when it hosted the Championship in
Hiroshima.


The Japanese team put on a thrilling show, demonstrating that they
would have a say in the <TIMEX2 val="2002" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2002</TIMEX2> World Cup finals which it is hosting
with South Korea.


The Asian Federation also chose the goal scored by Iranian Karim
Bagheri in South Korea's goal in the quarter-final as the Best Goal.


Bagheri launched a powerful ball from about 35 meters which went into
the top of the Korean goalkeeper's net, but the goal was not enough
as the latter team went on to score two goals after that.
