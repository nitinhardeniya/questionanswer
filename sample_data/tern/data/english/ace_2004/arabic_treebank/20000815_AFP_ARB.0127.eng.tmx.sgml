The United Nations announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> that it is to resume
humanitarian missions to Sudan within <TIMEX2 val="PT24H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-08-15" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next 24 hours</TIMEX2> after

civilian installations and aid workers.


A spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan said
the Secretary-General "is happy to announce that the United Nations
will resume all its humanitarian missions to the Sudan as of
<TIMEX2 val="2000-08-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August 16</TIMEX2>."


Spokesman Manuel Da Almeida Silva said Anan "welcomes the guarantees
received from Sudan's president (Omar al-Bashir) that every measure
will be taken to ensure the safety of planes and workers involved in
the LifeLine Sudan project."


He added that the Secretary-General "trusts the Sudanese government
and various disputing parties to continue to keep their promise to
ensure the safety of aid workers and of vulnerable civilians whose
urgent needs the United Nations is attempting to meet."


LifeLine Sudan was set up in <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2>, under an agreement between
Khartoum and the United Nations, to allow humanitarian aid to be sent
to areas ravaged by the civil war.
