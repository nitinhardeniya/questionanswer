Abu Dhabi <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

The Emirates news agency reported that Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir made a short visit <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> to Abu Dhabi in the
course of which he discussed "developing cooperation" with the United
Arab Emirates.

national concord through Libyan-Egyptian mediation," launched in

Since <TIMEX2 val="1983" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1983</TIMEX2>, Sudan has lived through a civil war between the north,
with a majority population of Arab Muslims, and the south with its
majority population of animists and Christians.

The northern opposition has also taken up arms to bring down the
ruling regime in Khartoum.


The Sudanese president's previous visit to the Emirates was <TIMEX2 val="2000-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last
January</TIMEX2> when the president of the Emirate states, Sheikh Zayid Ben
Sultan Ben Al Nihyan, expressed his support for al-Bashir's decision
to exclude his main rival within the regime, Islamist Hassen
al-Turabi.
