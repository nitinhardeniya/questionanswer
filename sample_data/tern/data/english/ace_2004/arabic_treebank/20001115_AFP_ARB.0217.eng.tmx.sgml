Bandar Seri Begawan <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

A Japanese official announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> that Japan and Russia
are to hold a summit before <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of the current year</TIMEX2> in an attempt
to find a solution to their dispute about the Coral Islands, which
has hindered the signing of a peace treaty between the two countries
since the end of World War II.


The decision to hold the summit was made during the meeting between
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori on the periphery of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in Brunei.


The Japanese official said that those responsible had "agreed to meet
at Irkotsik (east Russia) before <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of the year</TIMEX2>.


In <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2>, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister
Riotaro Hashimoto agreed to sign the peace treaty before <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of
2000</TIMEX2>, but negotiations have not progressed much since <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Do they mean 1997 or the end of 2000?">then</TIMEX2>.


Russia and Japan have been unable to sign a peace agreement since
<TIMEX2 val="1945" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1945</TIMEX2> because of their dispute concerning four of the Coral islands
located between Russia and Japan and which were invaded by Russian
forces in <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1945" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the last few days of World War II</TIMEX2>.


Putin visited Japan <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Do they mean this september or the one in 1999? Because I know it is translated text, it is hard to decide.">last September</TIMEX2> but the visit did not produce any
result on the issue of the islands.
