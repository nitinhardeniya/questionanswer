Bandar Seri Begawan <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

A high-level American official announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> in the wake
of the meeting between American President Bill Clinton and his
Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Putin's proposals on reducing
the Russian and American nuclear capability to under 1500 nuclear
heads does not include "many new elements."


The official who wished to remain anonymous confirmed "we have paid a
great deal of attention to President Putin's announcement but it does
not contain many new elements, in fact just a few new disparities
which require further examination and discussion by experts."


Clinton and Putin are taking part in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Bandar Seri Begawan the capital of the
Sultanate of Brunei.

The presidents met for a working lunch of <TIMEX2 val="PT75M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-15" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">around 75 minutes</TIMEX2>.


The American official stressed that what is important in Putin's
proposal is that it falls within the "framework adopted by the United
States and Russia to discuss strategic issues from a defensive and
offensive point of view."


Putin proposed limiting the Russian and American nuclear capabilities
by reducing the number of nuclear heads to under 1500 each, a smaller
number than that in the Russian-American Start-3 treaty <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">currently</TIMEX2>
being negotiated.

He proposed that the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> reduction should be between 2500 to 2000
nuclear heads.


Putin said this reduction would depend on compliance with the
Russian-American anti-ABM missile treaty signed in <TIMEX2 val="1972" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1972</TIMEX2>, which the
Americans are attempting to amend to set up anti- missile defenses
(NMD).


Washington has so far confirmed agreeing to the 2000 to 2500 nuclear
warhead ceiling.

The United States has not taken a final position on the NMD system
because Clinton, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-01" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">whose term</TIMEX2> ends in <TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January</TIMEX2>, is leaving the decision
in this matter to his successor.


In response to a question about Republican presidential candidate
George Bush Junior's approach to deploying the NMD system, more
ambitious than the one proposed by the Clinton administration, the
American official said the United States would continue "complying
with the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2> framework" in these strategic discussions.


He added "while this framework does not reflect the basic interests
of the United States, we feel it is still a valid approach in our
discussions with Russia on this matter."


He also said that Clinton raised the issue of the transfer of
sensitive Russian technology to Iran, adding "President Putin has
expressed his agreement that these are real threats and is strongly
committed to limiting this, but there is still a lot of work to do"
in this area.


Clinton also touched on the matter of American Edmond Bob who is
being tried in a closed court in Russia on charges of spying. The
United States believes he is innocent of these charges and is
demanding his release on humanitarian grounds.


The official said Putin understands our concern and we hope he will
do something as quickly as possible."
