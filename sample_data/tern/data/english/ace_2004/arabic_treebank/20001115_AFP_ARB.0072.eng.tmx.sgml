Baghdad <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

The head of the French Interests Section in Baghdad, Ambassador Andre
Janier, <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> welcomed Iraq's decision to deal in euros and
said this would encourage relations between the two countries.


In an interview in <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s edition of the official newspaper
"al-Jamhouriya," Janier said "we French believe this decision is
positive for the international economy, and this decision encourages
economic relations, especially in terms of oil, between Iraq and
France."


The French diplomat carried on to say "we have a vested interest in
this matter as Europeans and French because all trade payments and
exchanges are paid in euros and there is no danger to European and
French companies because of fluctuations in the price of the dollar
on the stock exchange. This compensates for any loss in buying and
selling in euros rather than dollars."


Iraq decided to deal in euros, rather than the dollar, as of <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
sixth of this month</TIMEX2> for its oil sales and outside trade deals.
