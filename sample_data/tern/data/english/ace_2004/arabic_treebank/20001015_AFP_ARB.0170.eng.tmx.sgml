Petra, Jordan's official news agency, reported a military spokesman

An Israeli military source had previously announced that two Israeli
soldiers received minor injuries <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> in a shooting originating from
Jordan in the Jordan Valley to the north of Jericho on the West Bank.

Jilgal about ten kilometers north of Jericho near the Jordanian
border.

The two soldiers were carrying out a routine patrol when they were
shot at.
