Moscow <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">8-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

Interfax news agency reported that Russian naval commander, Admiral
Vladimir Kuroyedov, said that the Navy hopes to start operations to
rescue the crew on board the Kursk <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this evening</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>, by sending
down a specialized diving bell to latch onto the sunken submarine.


Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeev had announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this afternoon</TIMEX2>
that the Russian Navy had already commenced the "rescue operation" to
bring up the 116 crewmembers on board the Kursk.


However, Russian Naval Commander, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, said on
television that "preparations for the rescue" would begin <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-08-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> that
the storm over the Barents Sea has died down.


He said the operation to evacuate the sailors would not actually
begin until <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15T24:00" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">midnight</TIMEX2> (<TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15T20:00Z" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">20h00 GMT</TIMEX2>) under the best circumstances if the
weather remained calm.


The diving bell that will be lowered to bring up the crew is a
specialized vessel designed specifically to help rescue the crews of
submarines in trouble.

This bell, which will be lowered from a boat at the sea's surface,
will latch onto the submarine's escape hatch, allowing the crew to
cross into it.


In principle, the submariners can then leave the submarine and rise
to the water's surface inside the bell.


The Admiral went on to say that the "important factor is that the
weather is good," suggesting that the operation may not go ahead if
the storm does not die down.


However, one expert, retired Captain Igor Kudrin, warned in response
to a question on NTV that since "the submarine is lying on the seabed
at an angle of 60 degrees, this operation will be extremely
difficult."


He said that in practice it was "impossible for a vessel to latch
onto an escape hatch at this angle."
