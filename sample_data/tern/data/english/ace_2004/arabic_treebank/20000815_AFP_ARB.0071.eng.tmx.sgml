Beirut <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">8-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

Lebanon has asked the international peacekeeping force operating in
the south to investigate reports indicating that Israel is
penetrating the shared border between the two countries and to
prevent this from happening.


According to official sources, the Lebanese authorities contacted the
peacekeeping high command and asked it to put an end to infringements
by Israel, which is carrying out operations inside Lebanese
territory, in particular dumping sand and building slopes.


The source added that if this is confirmed, then such acts constitute
a provocation and an infringement of Lebanese sovereignty.


Witnesses said two Israeli bulldozers started work <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> on a
slope in the Abbad sector inside Lebanese territory on the border
between Lebanon and Israel.


These witnesses told Agence France Presse that an Israeli army patrol
equipped with ultra-modern binoculars penetrated a few meters into
Lebanese territory but withdrew back to Israeli territory as soon as
a peacekeeping patrol arrived.


Families in southern Lebanon visit this area where, according to
tradition, the burial site of Sheikh Abbad, who died <TIMEX2 val="1500" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">500 years ago</TIMEX2>,
is located.

For their part, Israelis also regard the site as a shrine because,
according to them, Rabbi Ashi lived there in <TIMEX2 val="0400" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 5th century</TIMEX2>.


The Israeli army had previously carried out operations inside
Lebanese territory in the same border region on <TIMEX2 val="2000-08-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August 11</TIMEX2>.


<TIMEX2 val="2000-08-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last Friday</TIMEX2>, an Israeli bulldozer crossed the wire fence in Wadi
Marjayoun near the Israeli village of Matla and spread sand over a
length of hundreds of meters and a width of six meters in order to
expose the footprints of people crossing the border or tire prints of
cars from the Lebanese side.
