London <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">9-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

Patrick Jephson, Princess Diana's secretary between <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>,
has said that he will publish a book in <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October</TIMEX2> about the late
Princess' life and that it is "truthful and balanced" and not
controversial as feared by the Royal family.


Jephson, who was also Prince Charles' secretary for <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">two years</TIMEX2>, said
that the Princess confided in him a great deal, especially in the
years preceding her divorce from the heir to the throne in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>.


Gievson resigned from his position after Diana admitted on a
television program, which she had not informed him about, that she
had an affair with an army officer.


In a statement issued <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, Jephson stressed that his book
would respect the Princess' memory who died in a road accident on
<TIMEX2 val="1997-08-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August 31, 1997</TIMEX2> in Paris alongside her friend Dodi Fayed.


The author said: "Since her death, I have been amazed at the
worthless comments made about her, most of them incorrect and some of
them apparently intended to diminish her memory."


He stressed that the book is a "truthful and balanced account
intended as a service to the late Princess and those who worked for
her."


But his statement will probably not convince Prince Charles and Queen
Elizabeth II who will also issue a statement <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> expressing their
opposition to the book's publication.


Jephson said that he is aware of the anxiety of those close to Diana
as <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the publication date</TIMEX2> draws nearer, adding "I am confident they
will be reassured" once they read the book.
