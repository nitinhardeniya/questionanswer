Bandar Seri Begawan <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">11-15</TIMEX2> (AFP) -

American President Bill Clinton attempted <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> to reassure
money markets about doubts caused by the battle between the
Republicans and Democrats on the result of the presidential elections
in the United States, which is still unknown and dependent on the
results of the recount in the State of Florida.


Clinton told a group of businessmen on the periphery of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Brunei that "one of the
issues both Vice-President Al Gore and Governor George Bush agree on
in these elections is the need to maintain a strong and pioneering
role by the United States in order to achieve flourishing trade and
greater integration for the world's economy [...] and the world
should not be concerned because the two candidates are strongly
committed to following this path."


The American stock market saw an upheaval as a result of the delay in
announcing the final results of the presidential elections in the
United States but it improved on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>.


Initial results in Florida on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-14TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday evening</TIMEX2> showed Republican
candidate George Bush to be 300 votes ahead of Democrat candidate Al
Gore but some voting stations were still recounting votes <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>.


In Brunei, President Clinton refused to make any predications about
who might win the presidency in this exceptional election battle
between the Democratic and Republican candidates.


He said "we must be careful when we talk about predictions; the only
thing I can predict with confidence is that I will not be taking part
in the next Apec summit <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2> and at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-15" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2>, I can't say who
will be representing the United States."
