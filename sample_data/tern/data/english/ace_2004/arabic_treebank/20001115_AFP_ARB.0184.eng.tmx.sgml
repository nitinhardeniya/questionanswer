Military officials who also attended the meeting that Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat "wants to drag Israel into an escalation
which would lead to international intervention."


The head of the prime minister's office, Jalaad Shir, had previously
said on official television that "a compromise must be found between
a studied response not leading to escalation and the need to pave the
way for political openness, on the condition that the Palestinians
resolutely stop the violence and incitement to violence."


Shir added "only then will it be possible to think about resuming the
political process and on what basis."


The security cabinet was convened to a session with the aim of
examining new measures to deal with the escalation in attacks against
Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
