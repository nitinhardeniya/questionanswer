Lebanon's Prime Minister Salim al-Hus called <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> on Arab
countries with diplomatic relations with Israel to break of these
relations and to "boycott Israel economically in the broadest manner
possible" in support of the Palestinian nation's intifada.


In a speech at the opening of the Arab National Congress and
National-Islamic Congress, held in Beirut under the banner
"Supporting the Palestinian Intifada," al-Hus said "we call on the
Arab nations, peoples and governments, to support the Arab
Palestinian people in their struggle and battle."


He added "the primary expression of this support can only be through
breaking off diplomatic relations and all exchanges with Israel and
boycotting Israel economically in the broadest manner possible."


Hizbollah's secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, had announced in a
speech in Cairo in the presence of al-Hus that Islamic Resistance,
the armed wing of the fundamentalist movement, had "succeeded in
capturing an Israeli officer with the rank of colonel."


180 political and religious personalities from the Arab world are
taking part in the <TIMEX2 val="P1D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-15" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">one-day</TIMEX2> congress which ends with a closing
statement.
