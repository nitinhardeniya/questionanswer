MEES: Iraq Asked for 50 Cents More per Barrel of Oil
</HEADLINE>

Nicosia (AFP) -

An article in the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) published <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> reveals that Iraq has asked its clients to pay 50 cents
more per barrel of oil over the official oil price as of <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 1</TIMEX2>
into an account not under United Nations supervision.


The specialist magazine published in Nicosia reported that the Oil
Marketing Organization (SOMO) had "asked Iraq's clients to pay 50
cents more per barrel of oil over the official oil price as of
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 1</TIMEX2> into an account not under United Nations supervision."


MEES added that "the organization warned that oil companies who
refuse to do so would lose their allocation."


Iraq's clients have been informed of this <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-15" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">over the past few days</TIMEX2>.


Oil revenue from the Oil for Food program, which the Iraqi government
is not permitted to use as it wishes, is deposited into a BNP-Paribas
frozen account in New York and is used to fund a humanitarian
program.


Under the program, Iraq is permitted to sell crude oil to buy basic
goods for its population, which has been burdened with an embargo
imposed since <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2>.


MEES believes Baghdad's decision could lead to a crisis with the
United Nations and result in "Iraqi oil exports being stopped in
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early December</TIMEX2> unless a solution is reached before <TIMEX2 val="2000-12" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">then</TIMEX2>."


It added that companies had informed the Oil Marketing Organization
(SOMO) that they "would not be able to comply with the decision for
two reasons: firstly, because the decision violates United Nations
resolutions which stipulate that Iraqi oil revenue must be deposited
in a frozen account.


Secondly, because this increase (50 cents barrel) is expensive and
comes after Iraq's decision to price oil deals in euros [...] which
means a 15 cent increase per barrel."


MEES had reported on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> that it was unlikely that Iraqi oil
exports would be stopped, especially as Baghdad is making every
effort to ease the severity of sanctions.


MEES closed by saying that "Iraq set up a plan to ease the sanctions
after it concluded that the International Security Council would not
take such an initiative."
