Ga. Teen Pleads Guilty in Shooting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONYERS, Ga. (AP) _ A teen-ager entered dual pleas of guilty and
guilty but mentally ill <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> in a <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1999</TIMEX2> school shooting that left
six fellow students wounded. 

A judge will consider the results of mental evaluations on
<TIMEX2 val="P17Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">17-year-old</TIMEX2> T.J. Solomon before deciding which of the two pleas to
accept. 

If the judge accepts the guilty pleas to all 29 charges, including
aggravated assault, cruelty to children and weapons violations,
Solomon could be sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P211Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">up to 211 years in prison</TIMEX2>. 

If the judge accepts the guilty-but-mentally-ill plea, Solomon would
still go to prison but would receive psychiatric treatment under the
care of prison doctors. 

Solomon, then 15, opened fire with a sawed-off rifle on hundreds of
students in a common area at Heritage High School in Conyers, about
25 miles east of Atlanta, <TIMEX2 val="1999-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">one month after the Columbine High
massacre in Colorado</TIMEX2>. Witnesses said he appeared to be aiming below
waist level. 

He then dropped to his knees and pointed a .357-caliber Magnum
revolver, first at his mouth and then at an assistant principal, but
then surrendered it to the man with a tearful: ``Oh, my God, I'm so
scared!'' 

Solomon's lawyers had argued that the teen-ager should be
hospitalized for mental illness, but a Georgia appeals court ruled
that he was not out of touch with reality at the time of the
shootings. 

Friends have said Solomon was upset over a failed romance, but he
was vague about his motives in a letter of apology <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this
year</TIMEX2>. 

``It is hard to describe how dark and isolated I felt leading up to
<TIMEX2 val="1999-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the date of my mistake</TIMEX2>,'' Solomon wrote. ``It almost made everything
in my life not worth waiting for.'' 

Cecil Brinkley, the assistant principal, was honored <TIMEX2 val="2000-W39" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> by
the Pittsburgh-based Carnegie Hero Fund Commission, established in
<TIMEX2 val="1904" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1904</TIMEX2> by Andrew Carnegie to recognize acts of heroism.
