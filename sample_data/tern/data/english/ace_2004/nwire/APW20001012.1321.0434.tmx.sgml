WARREN, Mich. (AP) _ A detective and a drug suspect were fatally
wounded during a struggle while the officer was booking him at
police headquarters. 

Officers said investigators were reviewing a videotape of the lockup
area in an effort to figure out the sequence of events that led to
the shooting <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday evening</TIMEX2>. 

Detective Christopher Wouters had arrested a suspect on drug
charges, Warren police Chief James Vohs said. Both were wounded
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11T18:30" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">around 6:30 p.m.</TIMEX2> after the man ``produced a gun and there was a
struggle,'' he said. 

Authorities did not immediately say whether the gun belonged to the
detective or the suspect. 

Wouters, 42, died <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11T19:30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">an hour later</TIMEX2> at St. John Macomb Hospital. The
suspect died <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later the same night</TIMEX2>, hospital spokeswoman Rebecca
O'Grady said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>. His name wasn't released. 

Vohs described Wouters, a <TIMEX2 val="P19Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">19-year</TIMEX2> veteran, as a good officer who was
married and had two young daughters. It was the first time since
<TIMEX2 val="1969" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1969</TIMEX2> that an officer has been killed in the line of duty in Warren,
a large blue-collar Detroit suburb.
