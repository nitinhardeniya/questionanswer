Ravens' Dilfer Prepares for Chance 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) _ The hardship and disappointment he endured
during <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">his most frustrating NFL season</TIMEX2> has made Trent Dilfer a wiser
man and a better quarterback. 

Dilfer, who started 76 games for Tampa Bay from <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1999</TIMEX2>, will
get his first start with the Baltimore Ravens on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>. He has been
given the job of reviving a struggling offense that hasn't produced
a touchdown in four games. 

It may take Dilfer a while to adjust to the speed of the game, and
his right arm could very well be a little rusty during <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the first
quarter</TIMEX2> against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 

Mentally, however, he should be in prime form. 

``I have prepared <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">all year</TIMEX2> as if I was the starter. That is the way
you have to be as a backup, in order to be ready,'' Dilfer said.
``My routine won't change a whole lot. My focus won't change because
I am very focused.'' 

Dilfer signed with the Ravens as a free agent in <TIMEX2 val="2000-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">March</TIMEX2>, knowing that
his job would be nothing more than serving as an emergency
replacement for Tony Banks. He realized that his credentials _
Dilfer ranked fourth in touchdown passes and winning percentage
among starting NFL quarterbacks from <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">99</TIMEX2> _ were irrelevant. 

He simply could have gone through the motions, but instead showed up
for work on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">his day off</TIMEX2> and was always one of the last to leave the
practice field. 

His determination stemmed from <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">his most difficult season as a
professional</TIMEX2>. 

<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last season</TIMEX2>, Dilfer lost his starting job in <TIMEX2 val="1999-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October</TIMEX2>, then was
forced back into the lineup after his replacement was injured.
Dilfer then guided the Bucs to four straight wins in <TIMEX2 val="1999-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">November</TIMEX2> before
a fractured right clavicle ended <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">his season</TIMEX2>. 

``I think the two hardest things that I have had to deal with in my
career were being benched on a permanent basis and watching
throughout the whole playoffs,'' he said. 

His fall from grace altered his perspective. 

``When I got benched <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>, the big thing was for me to figure
out what I was going to do next,'' Dilfer said. ``When I came back,
I thought I played some of the best football in my career because I
just let go. I said to myself that I have failed already, so what is
there to be scared of?'' 

That's the attitude he will bring into the huddle <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> against the
Steelers, who are suddenly pressing the Ravens for second place in
the AFC Central. 

Starting <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2> behind Banks, Dilfer didn't play the role of a
disgruntled backup or an uninterested veteran. 

Instead, he quickly made himself a part of the team. 

``He has been as good as a man can be in that situation,'' Ravens
coach Brian Billick said. ``He has actively been a part of what we
are doing since he got here, whether it's sitting in the room
discussing defenses with (rookie quarterback) Chris Redman or doing
a play checklist with Tony. It's a tough job for a backup to stay
mentally tough, and you can't ask for much more than what he has
done.'' 

The only other thing the Ravens are asking from Dilfer is a
touchdown. Baltimore hasn't reached the end zone in <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October</TIMEX2> and has
lost two straight games despite owning the top-ranked defense in the
AFC. 

``We're struggling offensively and we need to get jump-started,''
Dilfer said. ``You've got to love the challenge. This game is all
about facing challenges, and conquering them.''
