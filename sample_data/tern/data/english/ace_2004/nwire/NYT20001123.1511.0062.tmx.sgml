<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T17:17:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">It</TIMEX2>'s <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time</TIMEX2> again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing and
the media. 

_ Will Americans ever refer to <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day before <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thanksgiving</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> as
``<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thanksgiving Wednesday</TIMEX2>,'' as ABC did repeatedly <TIMEX2 val="2000-W47" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> in
commercials promoting its <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-3" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> sitcoms ``The Drew Carey Show''
and ``Spin City''? 

_ If a Hollywood studio makes a movie about the Florida election
standoff, would the title be ``It's a Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad
World''? 

_ How many readers of The Wall Street Journal noticed that an
article on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> carrying the headline ``Genetically Altered
Protein Is Found in Still More Corn'' ran adjacent to an
advertisement for a golf tournament on Fox Sports sponsored by Sun
Microsystems that featured a fanciful photograph of a gigantic ear
of corn as big as a Buick? 

_ Doesn't a new television commercial for Fidelity Investments,
centered on a telephone conversation between a female employee and a
male customer, resemble a Citibank campaign from <TIMEX2 val="198" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the late 1980s</TIMEX2> that
was so brilliantly parodied as the ``First Citiwide Change Bank''
commercials on ``Saturday Night Live''? 

_ Did shoppers at the New York supermarket chain Gristede's rush to
take advantage of a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T17:17:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> sale on the ``BIG 150-count box'' of
Scotties facial tissues, or did they recall that Scotties has
usually come in a 175-count box? 

_ Can Ocean Spray Cranberries get a refund on a full-page ad that
ran in newspapers on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 8</TIMEX2> and carried the headline ``Now That the
Election Is Over, You Can Focus on Some Real News''? 

_ Was it a coincidence that an ad for the Carnation Coffee-mate line
of coffee creamers in the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T17:17:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> issue of In Style Entertaining 2000
magazine ran opposite an article about ``great trends'' in
party-giving that began by describing carnations as ``the chic
flower of <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="can't tell when the present was in the recent issue">the moment</TIMEX2>''? 

_ Should an English teacher have been consulted before the Tropicana
division of PepsiCo produced posters that described its Pure Premium
orange juice as being ``as packed with Vitamin C as a bus on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a rainy
day</TIMEX2>''? 

_ Will Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear and James L. Brooks
complain about an ad from Campbell Soup Co. for Campbell's Cream of
Mushroom soup that carried the slogan ``As m'm! m'm! good! as it
gets''? 

_ Now that the Roundabout Theater Company is calling its new
facility in Times Square the American Airlines Theater, will the
ushers give out peanuts instead of Playbills? 

_ Why did the Reader's Digest Association go to the trouble of
airbrushing the identifying information from a label on a pair of
jeans worn by a man in a photograph featured in an ad for Reader's
Digest magazine, but leave the red tab on the back pocket that tells
everyone the pants are Levi's? 

_ Do television commercials for prescription drugs disclose that
side effects in tests were no worse ``than a sugar pill'' because
research found that consumers weren't familiar with the word
``placebo''? 

_ What was in the zeitgeist that led two disparate advertisers _
Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield and the MSN network of Microsoft _ to
introduce <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about the same time</TIMEX2> campaigns centered on butterflies? 

_ And what was in the zeitgeist that led two automotive marketers _
Land Rover and Volvo _ to introduce <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about the same time</TIMEX2> commercials
centered on drivers rescuing animals on rainy roads? 

_ Are folks old enough to remember the heyday of the radio and
television personality Arthur Godfrey reminded of his <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">longtime</TIMEX2>
greeting, ``How are ya?,'' every time they hear the name of the new
Lucent Technologies spinoff company, Avaya Communication? 

_ How appealing was a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-23T17:17:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> offer made by Sprint Communications Co.
to give buyers of a Sprint PCS telephone and a calling plan a free
``pre-owned phone''? 

_ Was it an inside joke that the name of the character played by
John Corbett on ``Sex and the City,'' Aidan Shaw, was almost
identical to the name of a <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">longtime</TIMEX2> star of gay sex films, Aiden
Shaw? 

_ How many tickets did the Houston Grand Opera sell after mailing
out a promotional brochure featuring photographs of cattle with
headlines like ``It's udderly fantastic entertainment!'' and ``Great
opera. No bull.''? 

_ If CBS shows the first episode of ``Survivor II'' after its
broadcast of Super Bowl XXXV, will the network someday show the
first episode of ``Survivor XXXV'' after its broadcast of Super Bowl
LXVIII? 

_ Will cheerful chorus members dressed in V-neck sweaters interrupt
their serenades to online shopping long enough to tell an
advertising columnist, ``You ask a lot of questions for someone from
Brooklyn''?
