One Race May Determine Texas Senate 
</HEADLINE>

PALESTINE, Texas (AP) _ With the Republicans clinging to a one-vote
majority in the state Senate, control of the chamber could hinge on
a single race in East Texas. 

Republican Todd Staples, a three-term state representative, faces
Democratic lawyer David Fisher in the <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 7</TIMEX2> election. Although 14
Senate seats are up for election <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, this is the only race
without an incumbent. 

The question of which party controls the Texas Senate is especially
important <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2> because the Senate will redraw congressional and
legislative districts and could elect the next lieutenant governor
if Gov. George W. Bush is elected president and is succeeded by Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry. 

``From a small election in one state Senate race comes a lot,'' said
Bob Stein, professor of political science at Rice University in
Houston. ``It will determine the fate of the Democratic Party and,
largely, the Republican Party in the state of Texas.'' 

The GOP captured control of the Senate in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>, giving Republicans
their first majority in either legislative chamber in <TIMEX2 val="P120Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">120 years</TIMEX2>.
They <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-24T18:29:28" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> hold the slimmest majority possible _ 16-15. Around the
state, only one incumbent, a Democrat, is considered vulnerable. 

While Democrats have controlled the Texas House since <TIMEX2 val="187" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1870s</TIMEX2>,
their majority has been diminishing since <TIMEX2 val="198" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1980s</TIMEX2>. They <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-24T18:29:28" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> hold a
78-72 advantage. Only five of eight seats without an incumbent are
contested. 

The heavily wooded Senate district stretches from Tyler to north of
Houston, with logging, oil and gas exploration and outdoor
recreation among the main industries. The district also is home to
Jasper, where a black man was dragged to his death from a pickup
truck by three white men in <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2>. 

The Senate seat in the traditionally Democratic region is being
vacated by Republican Sen. Drew Nixon, who decided, with the
encouragement of the GOP, not to seek <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">another term</TIMEX2>. In <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2>, Nixon
was sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P6M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1997" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">six months in jail</TIMEX2> for propositioning a policewoman
posing as a prostitute. He did <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">his time</TIMEX2> on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX-WE" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="This could be anchored as AFTER 1997, but we are not anchoring point expressions now.">weekends</TIMEX2> while continuing
to serve as a lawmaker. 

The high-stakes race to replace Nixon has become one of the most
expensive legislative contests ever. 

State Senate candidates typically spend less than $35,000, Stein
said. 

But Staples said he has raised nearly $1.9 million. Of 1,944 donors,
19 are from outside Texas. More than 835 are from outside the
district. 

And Fisher said he has raised about $1.4 million. Of 1,400
contributors to his campaign, fewer than 20 are from out of Texas,
and they contributed about 2 percent of the total amount raised, he
said. About 40 percent of the contributors live in the district. 

Both candidates support pay raises for prison employees and more
affordable health insurance for teachers and vow to oppose any plan
to transfer water out of East Texas. 

Fisher, who is 37 and is making his first try for office, opposes
school vouchers. Staples, who is also 37, said he supports vouchers
if approved by local votes. 

The votes of about 9,000 residents of a recreational vehicle park
could be pivotal. Their eligibility to vote was challenged by other
residents of the district because many of them spend <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">most of the
year</TIMEX2> traveling. But a federal judge <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-24T18:29:28" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> cleared the way for the
RV owners to vote. 

Staples has accused Fisher of masterminding the challenge because
the RV owners largely vote Republican. Fisher denied it.
