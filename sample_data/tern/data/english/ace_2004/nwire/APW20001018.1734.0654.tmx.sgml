Lieberman Holds Environment Dear

WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) _ Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> that to him and Al Gore, protecting the
environment is ``a matter of faith.'' 

``The environment is the work of God,'' Lieberman told about 500
people at Bluegill Bay Park. 

Lieberman kept the pressure on Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
environmental record with his visit to this battleground state <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
day after Gore and Republican Bush tangled in their third and final
presidential debate</TIMEX2>. 

<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">A day earlier</TIMEX2> in Little Rock, Ark., Lieberman said Houston has ``the
dirtiest air in America.'' 

``Texas has the most industrial air pollution of any state in the
country, has the third worst water pollution,'' he said. ``I hope
Governor Bush doesn't want to do for America what he's done for
Texas.'' 

Polls show that Wisconsin and its 11 electoral votes are up for
grabs. While Vice President Gore has led in the most recent polls,
his advantage has been within the margin of error. 

In Arkansas, Lieberman also told about 700 supporters that he and
Gore would sustain the country's economic boom and that Bush would
return the country to a time of deficits and recession. 

He cited statistics showing improvements in <TIMEX2 val="P8Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past eight years</TIMEX2>
under Gore and President Clinton, including 22 million new jobs,
smaller welfare rolls, and decreased crime rates. He ended each
example with the refrain, ``We're not going back. We're going to
keep going forward.'' 

Lieberman, an observant Jew who has argued for a greater role for
religious faith in public life, has framed his arguments in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-18" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent
days</TIMEX2> as a difference in fundamental values. 

``It's about our values of freedom and fairness and equal
opportunity that have always defined us as Americans. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-18T18:07:23" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> more than
ever we cannot afford to waste the talents of a single person. We
can't afford to go back to the failed policies of <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1992" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="before the Clinton/Gore years">the past</TIMEX2>,'' he
said. 

Lieberman also was traveling to Baltimore <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later in the day</TIMEX2> to attend
Democratic Party fund-raisers and then to New York for an appearance
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> on the <TIMEX2 val="TDT" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">daytime</TIMEX2> talk-show ``Live With Regis,'' followed by a
speech to the League of Conservation Voters. 

He said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>'s presidential debate ``might have been a turning
point in the election.'' 

``I thought finally it clarified the differences in these two
tickets and I think that's what the American people have been
waiting for. I think clearly a lot of people are swinging back and
forth. They were uncertain and they were waiting for some clarity.
And I just think on the important issues of who is best able to
continue America's prosperity, Al Gore is,'' Lieberman said.
