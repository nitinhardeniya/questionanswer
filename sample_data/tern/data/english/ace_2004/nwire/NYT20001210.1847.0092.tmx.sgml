FIFE LAKE, Mich. _ There are no teams of lawyers in this sleepy
little hamlet. There are no television anchors standing on
courthouse steps chattering endlessly about the latest twist in the
election dispute. 

There is an election dispute, a tie vote as a matter of fact. And
just as in Florida, votes have been recounted by hand, but the chief
executive's race remains unsettled. But that's where any comparison
between Florida and this <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-10T19:33:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> logging town 250 miles north of
Detroit ends. 

They have counted all the votes for Fife Lake Township supervisor
three times, twice on <TIMEX2 val="2000-XX-XXTNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">election night</TIMEX2> and once in a hand recount on
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 1</TIMEX2>. The result is 297 votes each for the incumbent, Dave
Stremlow, and the Republican challenger, Toni Larson. 

Nobody has said a word about a court challenge or another recount.
And the simple solution laid out in Michigan law will be followed
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-11TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday morning</TIMEX2> up the road a few miles at the county building in
Traverse City. There, Grand Traverse County Clerk Linda Coburn will
hold a box with two folded slips of paper, one marked ``elected''
and one marked ``not elected.'' The candidates will draw. The slips
of paper will be read. And the race will be over. 

``I'm speechless, no matter how I look at it,'' said Larson, adding
that she never thought of questioning the hand recount. ``Oh, gosh
no. How many times do you need a recount? That's crazy.'' 

Coburn said ties were rare but not unheard of. She has seen one
other in <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">her 20 years on the job</TIMEX2>. 

The race for township supervisor was an engaging one from the
beginning, since both Stremlow and Larson already sit on the
township's Board of Trustees _ Stremlow as supervisor and Larson as
township clerk. 

``It was interesting to watch the meetings, with her running against
him and them both having to sit together,'' said Pat Gibson, owner
of Gibson's Hardware Store, who occasionally attends meetings.
``There was a little give and take.'' 

Fife Lake came to life in <TIMEX2 val="1872" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1872</TIMEX2> and was a thriving logging town by
<TIMEX2 val="1885" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1885</TIMEX2>. Ice was harvested from the frozen lake in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WI" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the winter</TIMEX2> for
prerefrigeration ice boxes downstate. Now it is mostly a bedroom
community for Traverse City to the north and Cadillac to the south,
though some people make a living farming Christmas trees or from
summer tourism. 

The population is between 1,800 and 1,900, Stremlow said. 

Township government here mostly takes care of the volunteer fire
department and ambulance service. The <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> budget of about
$200,000 includes a $6,500 salary for the part-time supervisor,
Stremlow said. 

Although he admitted it was somewhat awkward to be challenged by his
own clerk, Stremlow said the race was cordial and positive, with no
striking campaign issues. 

``I think I've done a lot for the township,'' said Stremlow, 70, a
retired auto worker from Flint. ``We have a new ambulance and a new
fire wagon. And the kitty is a little better off than it was when I
started.'' 

``Both people are well liked,'' said Gary Gilmore, 52, as he sipped
his <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-09TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday morning</TIMEX2> coffee at the Sugar Bowl Restaurant.
``Everybody knows everybody here.'' 

Carl Fales, a <TIMEX2 val="P74Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">74-year-old</TIMEX2> retiree who voted for Larson, agreed. 

``They are both good people,'' Fales said. ``Either one will do
fine.'' 

Although the matter is being settled quietly, there was drama on
<TIMEX2 val="2000-XX-XXTNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">election night</TIMEX2>. The first count had Larson, a <TIMEX2 val="P66Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">66-year-old</TIMEX2> retired
school clerk, ahead by two votes. But Larson, as clerk, was
overseeing the count and she noticed that the tally did not match
the number of ballots cast. A second run through the counting
machine left Stremlow the winner by one vote. 

Larson requested a hand-recount, which was held <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 1</TIMEX2>. It was there
that one rejected ballot was discovered. Voters here cast ballots by
making a pen or pencil mark next to the candidate of their choice.
And Coburn said the rejected ballot had a slight mark next to
Stremlow's name but a clearly marked vote for Larson. The board of
canvassers, made up of two Republicans and two Democrats, all agreed
it was a vote for Larson, creating the tie, Coburn said. 

``I didn't agree to anything, I just sat there and watched,''
Stremlow said of the recount, though he said he never considered a
legal challenge. 

``Nope,'' Stremlow said with a laugh when asked if he had consulted
a lawyer. ``The job doesn't pay that much.''
