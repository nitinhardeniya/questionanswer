PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) _ Terry Shea, who failed to produce a winning
season in <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">four-plus years</TIMEX2> at Rutgers, will step down as coach at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
end of this season</TIMEX2>, a source close to the school told The Associated
Press <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>. 

Shea, who has an 11-41 record, agreed to resign after meeting with
athletic director Robert E. Mulcahy on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday afternoon</TIMEX2>, according
to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 

The Star-Ledger of Newark, Gannett Newspapers and The Record of
Hackensack reported <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> that Shea agreed to resign. 

Mulcahy and Shea signed off on his resignation <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02T19:30" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">around 7:30 p.m.</TIMEX2>, and
Shea then held a meeting with his football team at <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02T21:30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">9:30 p.m.</TIMEX2>, the
source said. 

Rutgers athletic director Robert E. Mulcahy called a news conference
for <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-03T12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday at noon EST</TIMEX2>. 

``That's when it will happen,'' the source said. 

Telephone calls to Mulcahy and Rutgers sports information director
John Wooding by The Associated Press were not immediately returned. 

The Scarlet Knights are 3-5 overall and 0-5 in the Big East
Conference. They have a bye <TIMEX2 val="2000-W44-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this weekend</TIMEX2>, then finish <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2>
with games against West Virginia, Notre Dame and Syracuse. 

After Rutgers posted a 1-10 record <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last season</TIMEX2>, Mulcahy told Shea he
had to have a winning record <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this season</TIMEX2> and the team had to avoid
the one-sided losses that embarrassed the school in <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent years</TIMEX2>. 

After opening <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2> with wins over Villanova, a Division IAA
program, and Buffalo, which <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-03T14:10:45" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> announced its coach would not
be returning <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next season</TIMEX2>, Rutgers lost its next five games by a
combined 232-43 margin. 

The skid ended <TIMEX2 val="2000-W43" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> with a victory over winless Navy. 

Shea replaced the fired Doug Graber in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2> with hopes of building a
program with a Bill Walsh-type West Coast offense. 

Shea never got the talent to make it happen. He posted records of
2-9, 0-11, 5-6 and 1-10. His five wins in <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2> after going winless
<TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the year before</TIMEX2> were enough to earn him Big East Coach of <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the Year</TIMEX2>. 

Rutgers was 4-29 in Big East play during Shea's tenure, including
1-16 in league road games. The Scarlet Knights gave up 40 or more
points in 23 games under Shea. 

Shea has <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">one year remaining on his contract</TIMEX2>, which has a base salary
of $160,000. 

Rutgers reportedly had started compiling a short list of candidates
to replace Shea. It includes head coaches Gary Darnell of Western
Michigan, Gary Pinkel of Toledo and two coordinators _ Miami
defensive coordinator Greg Schiano and Notre Dame offensive
coordinator Kevin Rogers.
