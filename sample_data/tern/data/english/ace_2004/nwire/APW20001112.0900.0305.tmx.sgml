BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) _ Police searched for separatist
activists in Indonesia's war-torn Aceh province <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> after tens of
thousands of people rallied demanding an independence referendum. 

The bodies of six people were found in the eastern part of the
region <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, raising the death toll from <TIMEX2 val="P4D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-12" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">four days of violence</TIMEX2> to
25, local hospital officials and police said. Two were soldiers,
they said. 

Most of the civilian victims were shot by security forces.
Indonesia's reformist-minded President Abdurrahman Wahid has blamed
the army and police for the deaths. 

In the provincial capital Banda Aceh, Indonesian security forces
opened fire at two cars after the rally <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-11TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday night</TIMEX2>, injuring six
local residents. 

Security forces patrolled the city in armored vehicles, and officers
carried out random identification checks, looking for separatist
leaders. 

Police blocked off roads and prevented thousands from returning
home. Intercity buses were shut down. 

Local media reports estimated that up to 100,000 people rallied
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> in Banda Aceh, demanding a U.N.-supervised vote for
independence. Witnesses put the figure at about 30,000. 

The rally's organizers accused security forces of preventing
pro-independence residents from reaching the capital for the rally,
which <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> attracted an estimated 250,000 people. 

Separatists have fought since <TIMEX2 val="1975" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1975</TIMEX2> for independence in Aceh, which
is rich in oil and gas and has a population of about 4.1 million
people. At least 5,500 people have been killed there in <TIMEX2 val="P1DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past
decade</TIMEX2>. 

The government plans to meet with the rebel group, the Free Aceh
Movement, in Switzerland <TIMEX2 val="2000-W45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> to try to stem the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-12T10:42:53" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2>
escalation in bloodshed. Both sides signed a truce in Geneva on <TIMEX2 val="2000-06-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June
2</TIMEX2>, but the violence has continued, killing at least 227 people since
<TIMEX2 val="2000-06-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">then</TIMEX2>. 

Meanwhile, a U.N. Security Council fact-finding team arrived <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>
in East Timor, which won broke from Indonesia <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>. 

The mission was to assess the security situation on the island after
the deaths of three U.N. aid workers in Indonesian West Timor in
<TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September</TIMEX2>.
