TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore said
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> their only chance for victory in his contest of the
Florida election would be shattered if they have to wait until
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> to begin counting disputed ballots, and they began an
appeal to the Florida Supreme Court to do the counting itself,
immediately. 

The appeal was filed with the District Court of Appeal <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-29TAF" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late
Wednesday afternoon</TIMEX2>, and will be submitted to the state's highest
court <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early Thursday</TIMEX2>, Gore's lawyers said. It essentially asks the
Supreme Court to take over Gore's contest lawsuit from the
slow-moving trial court, to count the ballots itself, and eventually
to declare Gore the winner if he wins the recount. 

But lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush said they had no intention of
allowing any hand counting to begin without a vigorous legal fight.
To that end, they persuaded Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls to order
1.1 million ballots _ every vote cast in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach
counties _ brought up from south Florida and placed in the court's
custody. 

That represents 83 times the number of disputed ballots that the
judge had agreed on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> to transport to Tallahassee at the Gore
team's request. And it could take <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W48" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">weeks</TIMEX2> if not <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">months</TIMEX2> to count them
all, the point that Barry Richard, Bush's chief trial lawyer here,
said he was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be
transported here. 

``We did it to make a point,'' Richard said in an interview. ``If
you recount any ballots, you have to recount all of them. Now, we
don't think any ballots should be counted, because the manual
recount of ballots is finished. But in the event the court
determines that some ballots should be counted, we wanted them here
so they could all be counted.'' 

Aware that they could not stop the movement of all the ballots,
Gore's lawyers barely objected to the move, asking only that the
disputed ballots that might contain hidden Gore votes be separated
from the mass. 

``I know when it's futile,'' said David Boies, Gore's chief trial
lawyer, to Sauls. 

Nonetheless, Gore's lawyers were furious at the move, aware that it
represents yet another enormous barrier to their hopes for an
immediate count of the 14,000 disputed ballots in the two counties
and a quick decision from the judge that Gore really won the
election. Even if the Florida Supreme Court should swiftly agree to
their request and orders the counting to begin by <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, that would
still put them <TIMEX2 val="P3D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three days behind their original timetable</TIMEX2>. And
facing <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 12</TIMEX2> deadline</TIMEX2> for the state to name electors for the
Electoral College, Gore has absolutely no days to spare. 

``It's a stunt,'' said Kendall Coffey, one of Gore's election
lawyers, as he stormed out of Sauls' courtroom <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, referring
to the request for all the ballots. ``They're trying to bog down the
case, the system, the clerk's office and everywhere else they can.'' 

The decision by Gore's lawyers to appeal the case shows how perilous
their situation is. By appealing, the lawyers were forced to put on
paper their fear that their case could be over if they cannot begin
counting ballots until <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>. 

The decision to wait until a <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> hearing ``is effectively a
final order denying all relief sought by plaintiffs because the
action <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-29T20:52:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> pending below must be completed before <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 12, 2000</TIMEX2>, in
order to offer any relief,'' said the notice filed with the Court of
Appeal. It adds, ``the court must allow <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">sufficient time to complete
an accurate and fair count of the contested ballots</TIMEX2>, which is
essential for the proper resolution of the contest action.'' 

But the decision to bring up all the ballots means that they will
not be assembled in Tallahassee until <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late Friday, <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day later than
planned</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. And even then, the hurdles are enormous. There will have to
be another hearing before the Florida Supreme Court, and Gore's
lawyers will have to refute three arguments to be raised by the Bush
team: There should be no more counting at all; if there is any
counting, it will have to include all 1.16 million ballots; and if
there is any counting of disputed ballots, dimples cannot be counted
as votes. 

If these issues are heard before Sanders, there will have to be
briefs, witnesses, and evidence on each point, which could take
<TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="can't tell what the anchor is">days</TIMEX2>. If the Supreme Court agrees to short-circuit the process,
there will still have to be lengthy briefs filed, and the court may
need to wait <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="anchor unclear">several days</TIMEX2> before finding <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time for yet another
momentous hearing in its schedule</TIMEX2>.
