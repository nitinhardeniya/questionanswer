The vice-presidential debate on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> between Sen. Joseph
Lieberman and Dick Cheney was watched by at least 28.5 million
people, the second-smallest audience on record for a
vice-presidential debate, according to Nielsen Media Research data. 

The lowest-rated vice-presidential debate on record was the
confrontation between Vice President Al Gore and Jack Kemp, on <TIMEX2 val="1996-10-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct.
9, 1996</TIMEX2>. It was watched by 26.6 million people. 

The highest-rated vice-presidential debate was the matchup between
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro and Vice President George Bush, on <TIMEX2 val="1984-10-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 11,
1984</TIMEX2>. It was watched by 56.7 million people. 

Nielsen executives said it was possible that the final audience
tally for <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>'s confrontation could be slightly larger than the
one released <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>. The ratings gathering process was complicated
by Fox's decision to show a baseball playoff game instead of the
debate. Some of its affiliated stations showed the debate <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later in
the evening</TIMEX2>, and Nielsen said it would not be able to count the
number of people who watched those showings until <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early next week</TIMEX2>.
The difference was not expected to be very significant. 

<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>'s estimated audience included viewers who watched on ABC,
CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN and the Fox News Channel.
