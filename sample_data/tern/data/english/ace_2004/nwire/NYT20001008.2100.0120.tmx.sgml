LONGBOAT KEY, Fla. _ As Vice President Al Gore fends off intensified
attacks on his credibility, his campaign and Democratic surrogates
are planning a multimedia offensive <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> that assails Bush for
his record in Texas and his occasional slips of the tongue, Gore
aides said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>. 

The Democratic strategy calls for Gore to delegate the attacks to
his aides so he can maintain his pledge to remain above the fray. 

Indeed, even as his aides were finalizing plans for their assault,
Gore discussed his education proposals on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-08TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX2> with
teachers, students and parents during a photo opportunity at his
residence in Washington. 

He then flew to this beach resort near Sarasota for <TIMEX2 val="P3D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">three days of
preparation for <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday night</TIMEX2>'s debate with Bush in Winston-Salem,
N.C., the second of their three scheduled encounters</TIMEX2>. 

But Gore's surrogates, including his running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, and the Democratic National Committee's national
chairman, Joe Andrew, will apparently feel little such restraint.
And Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, made it clear in an
interview that Gore aides do not feel bound by their candidate's
pledge. 

``The governor will be held to presidential standards when it comes
to describing his policy views,'' Lehane said. ``Thus far, he has
not met the Quayle standard.'' That was a reference to <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T21:13:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Vice
President Dan Quayle, who was renowned for his verbal slips while
serving under Bush's father. 

Similarly, Mark D. Fabiani, Gore's deputy campaign manager, told
CNN's ``Late Edition'' <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> that Bush ``was incoherent _ he was
babbling'' in trying to explain his own tax-cut proposal at a
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> campaign stop in Florida. 

Gore aides said the campaign had long planned to focus attention on
Bush's record in <TIMEX2 val="P4W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-07" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the four weeks before the <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 7</TIMEX2> election</TIMEX2>. But the
timing takes on additional significance because of the continuing
closeness of the race after the candidates' first debate <TIMEX2 val="2000-W40" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>
and because of the Bush campaign's efforts to label Gore as a
``serial exaggerator.'' Those words were used <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> by Bush's chief
strategist, Karl Rove, in an interview on CNN. 

The new Gore offensive will include Democratic National Committee
television advertisements about Bush's record on health care and the
environment. Several advertisements tailored to individual cities
and states have started being broadcast in selected markets in
<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent days</TIMEX2>. 

In environmentally conscious Seattle, for instance, one commercial
describes the smog in Houston and implores viewers to ``take a deep
breath and imagine Seattle with Bush's Texas-style environmental
regulation.'' 

An advertisement being shown in Iowa compares Texas' national
standing in health care and in student test scores with Iowa's
higher rankings. 

In addition, Lieberman will be dispatched to Texas for a ``failed
leadership tour'' <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2>, and Andrew will hold a news conference
on the subject here on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>. Other surrogates, including members
of Congress, also will be used, said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore
spokesman.

This is not a new role for Lieberman. He traveled to Houston in <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late
September</TIMEX2> to attack Bush's environmental record at a park in the
shadow of an oil refinery. Lieberman provided a preview <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> by
faulting Bush's environmental and health-care records in an
interview on CNN. 

``The fact is that George Bush's record on the environment in Texas
is horrible,'' he said. ``They have most toxically polluted air in
America. Houston is the dirtiest city. Kids in Houston don't know
whether they can go out to play <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2> until the school officials
or the local officials check the air quality.'' 

In addition to drawing attention to Bush's record on health care and
the environment, the Gore surrogates are also expected to discuss
Bush's approval of legislation permitting the carrying of concealed
weapons in churches, hospitals and nursing homes, Gore aides said. 

The Gore campaign, according to aides, will issue regular press
releases highlighting Bush's tortured syntax and will feature <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-08T21:13:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2>
examples on its Web site, like his disjointed description of his tax
plan on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>. The Democratic National Committee is issuing
similar releases by fax and e-mail messages, called ``Bush Lite,''
said Jennifer Backus, a party spokeswoman. 

Lehane, adopting a snippet of the vulgar phrase that Bush used to
describe a reporter <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2>, said that ``Bush has shown a
consistent pattern of making major-league mistakes'' when trying to
explain his policies.
