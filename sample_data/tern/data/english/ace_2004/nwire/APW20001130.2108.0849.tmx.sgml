Britain Forces Through Consent Law

LONDON (AP) _ After three defeats in the House of Lords, Britain's
Labor government resorted to rarely used powers <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> to pass
legislation lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to
16. 

House of Commons speaker Michael Martin said he was invoking the
Parliament Act to force through a Sexual Offenses Bill that makes
the age of consent the same for both homosexuals and heterosexuals.
It became law after being given Royal Assent by Queen Elizabeth II. 

Lawmakers in the House of Commons overwhelmingly approved the bill
<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this year</TIMEX2>, but the House of Lords <TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this month</TIMEX2> rejected it for
the third time. 

The Lords' powers, however, are limited to delaying legislation by
blocking it and bouncing it back to the House of Commons. The
Parliament Act was created to ensure that the will of the country's
elected lawmakers prevails. 

The bill brings Britain in line with most other European Union
nations. 

``It is a reform which, in my personal view, is long overdue and is
only right for a country that has a history of reform and
challenging prejudice,'' said Home Secretary Jack Straw, Britain's
top law enforcement officer. 

``This act will help us to build a safe, just and tolerant
society,'' he added. 

Angela Mason, director of the gay rights group Stonewall, said
Parliament's action was ``a great step toward equality.'' 

``When the history books come to be written I believe it will be
seen as <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the moment when this country finally began to change</TIMEX2>, when
lesbians and gay men started to take our place as equal members of
society,'' she said. 

Peter Tatchell, of the group OutRage!, said: ``This victory is a
welcome and historic milestone in the long struggle for gay human
rights.'' 

``My only regret is that it has taken <TIMEX2 val="P33Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">33 years</TIMEX2> during <TIMEX2 val="P33Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">which time</TIMEX2>
hundreds of gay men have been unjustly jailed for victimless
relationships.'' 

However, family values campaigner and Conservative ex-Leader of the
Lords Baroness Young accused the government of behaving in a
``completely dictatorial manner'' toward Parliament. 

Straw dismissed the criticism. ``In the circumstances I believe that
the use of the Parliament Act in this case is proper and
justified,'' he said. 

<TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Five years ago</TIMEX2>, Parliament narrowly rejected lowering the age of
consent for homosexuals to 16, reducing it instead from 21 to 18.

decades ago</TIMEX2>.
