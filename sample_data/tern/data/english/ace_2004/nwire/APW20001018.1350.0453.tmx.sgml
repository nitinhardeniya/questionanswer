WASHINGTON (AP) _ The 45.2 million Americans getting Social Security
checks will see them grow by 3.5 percent <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2>, the biggest
cost-of-living increase in <TIMEX2 val="P1DE" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">almost a decade</TIMEX2>. 

That's because inflation has picked up speed, almost entirely a
reflection of surging energy prices. 

The increases, which will begin showing up in benefit payments for
<TIMEX2 val="2001-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January</TIMEX2>, were announced by Social Security based on inflation
figures released <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> by the Labor Department. 

The cost-of-living announcement comes <TIMEX2 val="2000-W42" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">just weeks before Americans
elect a new president <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 7</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. Florida and Pennsylvania _ among the
tossup states in the presidential race _ have a large number of
older people, who tend to be the most likely to vote. 

Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, and
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat, have repeatedly clashed over
Social Security. Bush proposes allowing individuals some control
over how to invest their retirement funds, while Gore says that
would threaten the long-term solvency of the nation's huge
retirement system. 

The 3.5 percent increase was the largest since a 3.7 percent rise in
<TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2>. It means the average <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthly</TIMEX2> check for retirees will rise by
$29 to $845 <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2>, up from $816 <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>. 

That compares with an increase of 2.4 percent for <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2>, which
translated into an average of $19 <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a month</TIMEX2> more for retirees. 

In addition to retirement checks, the increases affect Social
Security benefits paid to disabled workers and families whose
breadwinners have died. 

The maximum <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthly</TIMEX2> payment for low-income individuals receiving
Supplemental Security Income, known as SSI, also will rise by 3.5
percent. That will boost the maximum <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthly</TIMEX2> SSI check by $18 to
$530. For a couple, the SSI maximum goes up $27 to $796. Increased
payments to SSI recipients will begin on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 29</TIMEX2>. 

``The <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> cost-of-living adjustment is one of the most critically
important features of the Social Security program,'' said Social
Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel. ``For the elderly, it
guarantees that their foundation of retirement income will remain
strong for as long as they live.'' 

Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services announced
that the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthly</TIMEX2> Medicare premium deducted from most elderly and
disabled Americans' Social Security checks for insurance coverage of
doctors' office visits will increase by $4.50 to $50 in <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2001</TIMEX2>. The
increase, which takes effect <TIMEX2 val="2001-01-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Jan. 1</TIMEX2>, reflects higher health-care
costs and changes in Medicare law. It is not based on the
cost-of-living adjustment tied to the CPI. 

Since <TIMEX2 val="1975" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1975</TIMEX2>, the benefit cost-of-living adjustment has been
automatic, requiring no vote by Congress. It is calculated based on
changes in the Consumer Price Index _ the government's inflation
yardstick _ from <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-Q3" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the third quarter of one year</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-Q3" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the corresponding
quarter of the next</TIMEX2>. 

Because of tame inflation, the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yearly</TIMEX2> benefit boosts have been below
3.0 percent since <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>. The <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1999</TIMEX2> increase of 1.3 percent, matched a
record low set in <TIMEX2 val="1987" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1987</TIMEX2>. 

<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-18T14:20:24" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">More recently</TIMEX2>, consumer prices have been edging up, largely because
of higher energy costs. Crude-oil prices hit a <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="context allows more specific anchor_val">10-year</TIMEX2> high in
<TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September</TIMEX2>, contributing to costlier gasoline and heating oil. 

While overall inflation is rising, it is still moderate compared
with <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">other periods</TIMEX2>. Double-digit inflation in <TIMEX2 val="197" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the late 1970s</TIMEX2>, for
example, drove the cost-of-living increase up to 14.3 percent in
<TIMEX2 val="1980" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1980</TIMEX2>. 

Social Security also announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> that for working Americans,
the maximum <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> earnings subject to Social Security taxes <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next
year</TIMEX2> will rise to $80,400 from $76,200. That limit along with the
Social Security tax rate of 6.2 percent is set by law.
