MARKET PLACE: TIME WARNER HOLDERS LOOK FOR <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">HAPPY DAYS</TIMEX2> AFTER THE AOL 
</HEADLINE>
MERGER &QL; By ALEX BERENSON &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; c.<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2> N.Y. Times
News Service &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; &LR; Back in <TIMEX2 val="2000-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January</TIMEX2>, when Internet
stocks were hot, America Online agreed to buy Time Warner with AOL
stock. The deal, if approved by regulators, would leave AOL
shareholders with 55 percent of the merged company, even though Time
Warner's revenue and cash flow are far greater. 

<TEXT>
Since <TIMEX2 val="2000-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">then</TIMEX2>, AOL's stock has fallen by almost a third, destroying
most of the premium the company had offered for control of Time
Warner. So a Time Warner shareholder might conclude that America
Online's chairman, Stephen Case, had bamboozled his Time Warner
counterpart, Gerald Levin, into taking AOL's shares at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the worst
possible time</TIMEX2>. 

``<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Short term</TIMEX2>, anyone objective would say probably Steve got the
better part of the deal,'' said Larry Haverty, a senior vice
president at State Street Research in Boston and a <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">longtime</TIMEX2> media
investor. 

But Haverty, like many other Time Warner shareholders and industry
analysts, hardly cares. With the merger likely to be completed <TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later
this month</TIMEX2>, he predicts that the merged company will grow quickly by
combining AOL's marketing skills and captive base of online users
with Time Warner's huge library of films, magazines and the like and
its relationships with major advertisers. 

``The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in the
world,'' Haverty said. ``<TIMEX2 val="2005" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Five years out</TIMEX2>, if you're a shareholder in
this company, you're going to be a happy camper.'' 

That view is widely shared. ``Strategically, it makes a lot of
sense,'' said Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein. ``These companies
fill the holes of the other one. They're subscription-advertising
combo models. The reality is the pieces are very compatible.'' 

To be sure, the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-01T22:12:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> history of big media mergers is hardly
comforting for shareholders in either AOL or Time Warner. Disney
stumbled badly after it bought Capital Cities/ABC in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>, and Time
Warner stagnated for <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1990" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">five years</TIMEX2> after it was created in <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2> by the
merger of Time and Warner. ``Huge deals are really hard to do and
create a lot of uncertainty,'' said Roger McNamee of Integral
Capital, which sold its 404,000 AOL shares <TIMEX2 val="2000-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day the merger was
announced</TIMEX2>. 

But if the merged company can overcome that hurdle, it will have big
advantages over Disney and other traditional media companies, which
are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the
Internet, said Jessica Reif of Merrill Lynch. 

``Given the multiple distribution platforms that they have, it's
obviously a very powerful consumer engine,'' Reif said. ``There's a
reason that you see Disney and to a lesser extent NBC screaming in
Washington.'' 

John Schreiber, an assistant portfolio manager at Janus Capital, the
mutual fund company that is Time Warner's largest shareholder, with
more than 120 million shares, said the companies had already begun
to demonstrate how they would work together. For example, AOL has
pitched Time Warner's magazines to its users, resulting in hundreds
of thousands of new subscriptions. And the companies are trying to
sell big advertisers on deals that will reach both America Online
users and the people who watch Time Warner cable channels and read
its magazines, Schreiber said. 

``Once the merger closes, I think you'll see some very powerful
cross-promotional deals across all of Time Warner's advertisers,''
he said. 

Schreiber also says the risk of cultural clashes between the
companies is limited, because the companies disclosed publicly where
top executives would stand in the combined company <TIMEX2 val="2000-WXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">only a few weeks
after the merger was announced</TIMEX2>. So people who feel their
responsibilities have been diminished have had <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-01" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">months</TIMEX2> to look for
new jobs, and some have already left, he said. 

Given the strength he sees in the combined company, Schreiber said
the question of whether Levin could have negotiated a better deal
with America Online is moot. Shares in cable companies like Comcast
have fallen 15 percent or more <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, while big media companies
have been flat or up slightly. So ``it's not as if Time Warner
shareholders have lost out on a great deal of upside,'' Schreiber
said.
