LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) _ The wife of Patrick Roy, the NHL's
winningest goalie, called 911 because she was afraid of what her
husband would do as they argued about in-laws, according to a police
report released <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>. 

Michele Roy was not hurt during the dispute at their home <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early
Sunday</TIMEX2>, but Roy admitted pulling a bedroom door off its hinges and
damaging another after his wife called Greenwood Village police and
hung up without speaking, the report said. 

The somber Colorado Avalanche goalie, accompanied by his parents,
sister and brother, stood with his hands clasped behind his back
during a brief court appearance. 

The initial hearing was postponed until <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 7</TIMEX2>. Roy remained free on
a $750 bail and left by a side door without comment. His wife was
absent. 

The judge also issued a restraining order that is standard in
domestic-dispute cases, which requires Roy to refrain from alcohol
and illegal drugs and possession of guns or weapons. He was
permitted to return home to his family and is allowed to travel with
the team to out-of-state games. 

After the Avalanche's practice, Roy read a brief statement, noting
that he could not comment on his arrest on the advice of his lawyer.
He also asked that the public respect his family's privacy. 

``Obviously, this is creating a distraction, and my wish is that
this distraction will be over soon,'' he said. ``I am thankful for
the support I am getting from my family and every one of my
teammates.'' 

Colorado players showed unified support for Roy, saying they believe
he will remain focused after an eight-game (6-0-2) unbeaten streak
to start <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2>. The team's next game is at home <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>
against Nashville. 

``We've always stuck together and we'll stick by Patrick,''
defenseman Ray Bourque said. ``We know he is a quality person and a
great family man.'' 

Defenseman Aaron Miller said, ``Until we find out exactly what's
going on, we're not going to let it bother us or distract us. I
think I speak for the whole team that we're behind Patty 100
percent.'' 

Roy, 35, was arrested and charged <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> with misdemeanor criminal
mischief which occurred during an act of domestic violence. 

If convicted, he faces <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a maximum of one year in the county jail</TIMEX2> and
a $1,000 fine, said a spokesman for the Arapahoe County district
attorney's office. 

Officers responded to the 911 hang-up call at Roy's residence, where
Michele Roy told them the two had been arguing. 

Roy was honored <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-20TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday night</TIMEX2> for winning his 448th game <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three days
before</TIMEX2>, a 4-3 victory in overtime against the Washington Capitals.
He broke the mark set by Terry Sawchuk.
