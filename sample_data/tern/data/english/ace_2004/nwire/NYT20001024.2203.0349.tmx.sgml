Compaq Computer reported earnings and sales that beat Wall Street's
expectations <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>, bolstering arguments that the company is
rebounding from problems that had hurt its performance <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last two
years</TIMEX2>. 

Compaq said it netted $550 million, or 31 cents a diluted share, in
<TIMEX2 val="XXXX-QX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the quarter ended <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sept. 30</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, a leap of 23 cents a share, or 288
percent, from <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-QX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-09-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the similar period in <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1999</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. About $25 million, or a
penny a share, came from investment income rather than operations,
but after discounting that boost, Compaq still beat the average of
analysts' projections by a penny a share. 

Compaq, which is based in Houston, reported worldwide revenue of
$11.2 billion for <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-QX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the quarter</TIMEX2>, an increase of 22 percent over <TIMEX2 val="1999-QX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-09-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment=""><TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
previous year</TIMEX2>'s period</TIMEX2>. Compaq said that revenues would have grown
26 percent but for the strength of the dollar, which reduced the
value of overseas sales compared with <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year ago</TIMEX2>. 

``Our results clearly demonstrate our tremendous momentum in the
marketplace,'' said Michael Capellas, chairman and chief executive.
``We're on a bit of a roll.'' 

Capellas noted that the strong growth had come from every region of
the world. He also expressed confidence that Compaq would meet its
previous projections of 18 percent revenue growth in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-QX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the current
quarter</TIMEX2> and 40 percent earnings growth in <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2001</TIMEX2>. 

Analysts were pleased, if not completely persuaded, by the positive
report. While Compaq reported strong overall growth in its server
business, several observers noted that the 5 percent growth in the
Unix server segment was well below the industry average. Similarly,
the 9 percent growth in the data storage business was an improvement
on <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-QX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">past quarters</TIMEX2>, but below the growth rate of competitors, like
EMC. 

Compaq is the world's leading maker of personal computers, and its
PC business was stronger than many analysts had projected. The
commercial PC unit had revenues of $3.5 billion, up 28 percent from
<TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year ago</TIMEX2>, and its operating income was $133 million, compared with
a loss of $169 million <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year ago</TIMEX2>. The consumer PC unit had revenue
of $2.1 billion, an increase of 45 percent over <TIMEX2 val="1999-QX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-09-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the year-ago period</TIMEX2>,
although a softening market and pricing pressures cut operating
income 3 percent to $63 million. 

Perhaps the biggest continuing weakness was in Compaq's services
business. Revenues attributed to Compaq's 40,000 consultants fell 2
percent, to $1.7 billion, and operating income dropped 16 percent,
to $254 million. Capellas said that improving that group's
performance was a high priority. 

Over all, though, Compaq enthusiasts like Kurtis R. King, an analyst
at Banc of America Securities who rates the company a ``strong
buy,'' said <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-QX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the quarter</TIMEX2> validated their bullishness. And even
skeptics who were not advising clients to buy the stock, like
Charles R. Wolf at UBS Warburg, called <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-QX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the quarter</TIMEX2> a good one. 

``They're turning, but the turn isn't completed yet,'' Wolf said. 

The results were released after the end of trading on the New York
Stock Exchange <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>. Compaq's shares closed up 70 cents, to
$28.40, on the Big Board.
