Syrian President Travels To Egypt

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In his foreign policy debut as Syria's
president, Bashar Assad met <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in talks on Mideast peace and the escalating violence in the
Palestinian territories. 

Assad, on his first trip abroad since becoming president in <TIMEX2 val="2000-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July</TIMEX2>,
also dealt with the issue of Iraq in the talks with Mubarak,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa said. 

The Syrian leader's visit came on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a fourth day of clashes that have
raged in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem, leaving more than
two dozen Palestinians dead</TIMEX2>. 

``There is complete agreement (between Mubarak and Assad) as to the
seriousness of the situation and that the negative repercussions
would adversely effect the peace process, which is in itself in a
very precarious state,'' Moussa said. 

Assad, 35, has focused on domestic issues since his father, Hafez
Assad, died in <TIMEX2 val="2000-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June</TIMEX2> after <TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-06" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="context allows more specific anchor_val">30 years in power</TIMEX2>. He has taken steps to
modernize his nation's bureaucracy and revive its stagnant economy. 

``This was the first meeting of the first visit of President Bashar
Assad after the funeral of his father, so it was only normal for the
discussions to have a general tone ... in addition to certain
specifics of special importance to both countries and the Arab
world,'' Moussa said. 

The late Syrian president rarely traveled abroad. In <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">his last few
years</TIMEX2>, however, he had sent Bashar, educated as an eye doctor, on
foreign trips as part of his grooming to become president. 

Prospects appear dim for progress on either the Syrian or
Palestinian peace track. The deadlock in Palestinian-Israeli talks
is exacerbated by the worst violence in <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">four years</TIMEX2>. Syria's
government-run media said <TIMEX2 val="2000-W39" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="i tthink it means the week that is ending now">last week</TIMEX2> that no progress could be
expected now because of the U.S. elections and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's precarious situation as leader of a minority
government. 

Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations broke down in <TIMEX2 val="2000-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January</TIMEX2>, with Syria
demanding a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau captured by Israel in <TIMEX2 val="1967" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1967</TIMEX2>. Israel insists on waiting to
settle borders until it knows what it will gain by returning Golan
land. 

Assad has made it clear he intends to follow his father's course in
any negotiations with Israel. 

Mubarak and Assad met after <TIMEX2 val="2000-W39" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a week when Russia, France, Jordan and
Yemen sent planes to Baghdad, challenging U.N. sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2> invasion of Kuwait</TIMEX2>. Iraq is hoping other Arab
countries will follow, despite U.S. complaints, easing its
isolation. 

Moussa said the presidents discussed the situation in Iraq and would
return to it <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>. However, he would not comment on whether Syria
and Egypt were planning to send planes to Baghdad. 

Egypt and Syria are on good terms, but they have had their
differences. Hafez Assad's attempts to rally Arab leaders to present
a unified front against Israel gained little ground. He derided
Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel in <TIMEX2 val="1979" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1979</TIMEX2>.
