WHEN A DIME MATTERS: LEVITT GOES AFTER OPTION MARKETS

Arthur Levitt, the longest-serving chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, is at it again. He's angry about ways in which
individual investors are badly treated, and he wants to do something
about it. 

On <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, Levitt will disclose what may be the final initiatives of
his term. Evidently unconcerned that follow-up will fall to an SEC
chairman named by the next president, he is putting pressure on
supposedly independent directors of mutual funds to hold down the
commissions the funds spend when they trade stocks, and on corporate
audit committees to do a better job. He is threatening SEC action if
companies continue to issue new stock options to top executives
without getting shareholder approval. 

Most important, Levitt is demanding that the options industry put
systems in place within <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">a year</TIMEX2> to allow its customers to experience
the benefits of decimalization by trading in penny increments. The
commission, Levitt said in remarks prepared for a speech at Fordham
University on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, should ``press the markets hard'' to do that. 

To understand his concern, consider trading <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> in Compaq
Computer securities. Compaq stock was trading with a spread of 4
cents between the best bid and the best asked price. At <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the same
time</TIMEX2>, the most actively traded option contract on Compaq had a
spread of 40 cents, 10 times as wide. The options exchanges' rules
bar any price change of less than a dime, while the stock price can
move by a penny. 

``Investors are being denied the benefits of lower spreads,'' Levitt
said. ``The industry is keeping the difference for itself.'' 

The history of competition in the options markets is not a pretty
one. The exchanges avoided real competition for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">years</TIMEX2>, and then
began to compete on the basis of kicking back money _ the polite
term is ``payment for order flow'' _ to brokers who send in customer
orders. Maybe such kickbacks lower commissions charged to customers,
but that is hard to prove. What is clear is that the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02T19:46:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> system
discourages price competition that would really help customers. 

Going to pennies would strain computer systems, but little has been
done to get systems that could cope. In an interview, Edward Joyce,
the president of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said the
industry was ``just acting prudently'' by going slowly. He gave no
timetable for change. 

<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Levitt's term as SEC chairman</TIMEX2> included the reform of the Nasdaq
market, action on abuses in the municipal bond market and the new
regulation to bar selective corporate disclosures. ``He's done
extraordinarily well,'' said Joel Seligman, the dean of the
Washington University law school and author of a history of the SEC.
``On Nasdaq and other issues, he pursued a principled approach
consistent with the goals of investor protection.'' 

Sometime before <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">his term</TIMEX2> ends, the SEC is likely to approve rules
that will limit the amount of consulting services auditors can
provide for their audit clients. 

On options or accounting or most anything else, a new SEC could
reverse Levitt and the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02T19:46:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> SEC. There is precedent for that.
<TIMEX2 val="1980" mod="BEFORE" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1979" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">Just over 20 years ago</TIMEX2>, the SEC approved a rule that forced auditors
to disclose consulting arrangements with clients. Then Ronald Reagan
won the election, and the rule was quietly repealed. 

By acting <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-02T19:46:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, Levitt is making such moves more difficult. ``I want
to be certain,'' he said in an interview <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, ``that my
successors and their successors do not forget the commitment to the
primacy of the individual investor as being central to the success
of our markets.''
