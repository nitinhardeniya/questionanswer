HONG KONG _ For <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">most of this year</TIMEX2>, Asia's economies have performed a
sort of levitating act _ growing by double-digit rates <TIMEX2 val="2000-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">month</TIMEX2> after
<TIMEX2 val="2000-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">month</TIMEX2> even as economists predicted they would fall to earth. 

That dichotomy was on vivid display here <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>: Hong Kong reported
that its economic output surged 10.4 percent in <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q3" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the third quarter</TIMEX2>,
and it raised its projection for <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="They are talking about fiscal years. Should it be marked as 2000 or not? I don't think that's necessarily accurate.">full-year</TIMEX2> growth to 10 percent from
8.5 percent. 

Yet a block away, the International Monetary Fund warned in a news
conference that Asian economies could be hit hard by soaring oil
prices and turmoil in the financial markets. The IMF said a $5
increase in the price of a barrel of oil could slow the growth rates
of Asian countries <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Again, I think they are talking about fiscal years here.">next year</TIMEX2>. 

``The prospects for growth in <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2001</TIMEX2> have weakened,'' said David
Robinson, assistant director of research at the fund. ``There has
also been increased political instability across the world, not
least in Asia.'' 

Several Asian countries _ notably the Philippines, Taiwan, and
Indonesia _ have been gripped by political tumult in <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W47" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">recent weeks</TIMEX2>.
The Philippines president, Joseph Estrada, was impeached <TIMEX2 val="2000-W46" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>,
while Chen Shui-bian, the president of Taiwan, is trying to fend off
a recall vote. 

Even in more stable countries, like Malaysia and South Korea,
Robinson said the Fund was concerned by the haphazard pace of
economic reforms. In many countries, the banks and corporations
remain financially shaky. 

``We're still seeing chaebols in deep trouble,'' he said, referring
to Korea's heavily indebted conglomerates. 

But Robinson acknowledged that these weaknesses had not yet been
reflected in the economic performance of the countries. On <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>,
South Korea reported a 9.2 percent increase in its <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q3" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">third-quarter</TIMEX2>
output _ beating the estimates of most analysts and extending <TIMEX2 val="PXQX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a
string of powerful quarters</TIMEX2>. 

Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore have also beaten expectations,
while Hong Kong's growth rate was nearly three percentage points
above a median forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. 

Like other Asian economies, Hong Kong has been buoyed by an
unquenchable appetite for its exports, principally in the United
States. Exports surged 17.7 percent in <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q3" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the third quarter</TIMEX2>. Hong Kong
has done a particularly booming business in repackaging and shipping
goods from mainland China. 

Consumer spending rose by a much less impressive 5.6 percent, as
retail sales slackened from <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q2" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the second quarter</TIMEX2>. And consumer prices
fell 2 percent, extending a decline that began during the crisis. 

Ian Perkin, chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce said the double-digit growth in Hong Kong and other Asian
countries masked their underlying condition. While the region's
growth in exports has been torrid, domestic demand has remained
tenuous. 

``We haven't built up our domestic economies yet,'' he said. ``The
recovery has relied almost completely on export growth. 

``If consumer spending slows down in the States, it will have a
devastating effect on Asia,'' said Perkin. ``<TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2001</TIMEX2> could be <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a crunch
year</TIMEX2>.'' 

Robinson of the IMF was similarly wary about <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2>. In <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October</TIMEX2>,
the IMF projected that the world economy would grow 4.2 percent in
<TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2001</TIMEX2>, while Asia as a region would grow 6.6 percent. On <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>,
Robinson said the growth rate could be lower, though he would not
say by how much. 

A principal culprit of possibly slower growth is the dependence of
many Asian countries on imported oil. Oil prices have risen $5 per
barrel since the IMF issued its <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-HX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">semi-annual</TIMEX2> economic outlook in
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October</TIMEX2>. 

Asia has little control over oil, but Robinson said the region could
improve its economic prospects by calming its political waters. 

One bright spot in the Asian landscape is China, which is on track
to record 8 percent growth in <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2>. Robinson said the main question
facing Chinese leaders was whether they need to spend billions of
dollars in public funds to further stimulate an economy that was
already expanding. 

Like Perkin, Robinson said Asia's future depended in large part on
the health of the United States. But he disputed those who predict
dramatically slowing growth _ the so-called hard landing _ for the
American economy. 

``The chances of that happening are less than 40 percent,'' he said,
``substantially less.''
