national champion, died <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 4</TIMEX2> in her New York home. She was 94. 

Gresser, who was born in <TIMEX2 val="1906" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1906</TIMEX2> in Detroit, taught herself to play
chess using a book that a fellow passenger gave her on a cruise in
<TIMEX2 val="1939" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1939</TIMEX2>. 

She was at the forefront of women's chess in the United States for
<TIMEX2 val="P3DE" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="194" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">more than three decades</TIMEX2>. She and a handful of other women, including
Sonja Graf Stevenson, Mary Bain and Mona May Karff, dominated
tournament competition from <TIMEX2 val="194" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1940s</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="197" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1970s</TIMEX2>. 

Gresser entered her first chess competition in <TIMEX2 val="1940" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1940</TIMEX2>. In <TIMEX2 val="1944" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1944</TIMEX2>, she
won her first U.S. Women's Chess Championship. 

She went on to win the championship eight more times, and became the
first woman in the United States to earn a master's rating. In <TIMEX2 val="1950" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1950</TIMEX2>,
she was also awarded an international woman master title. 

Throughout her career, Gresser represented the United States in
several international events. She played in five Women's Candidates
tournaments and three Women's Chess Olympiads. She was also Women's
World Chess Championship challenger in <TIMEX2 val="1949" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1949</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1950" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1950</TIMEX2>. 

She retired from professional chess at 82. In <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2> she became the
first woman inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame. 

Gresser studied classics as an undergraduate at Radcliffe College
and won a fellowship for classical studies at the American School of
Classical Studies in Athens, Greece. In <TIMEX2 val="1927" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1927</TIMEX2> she married William
