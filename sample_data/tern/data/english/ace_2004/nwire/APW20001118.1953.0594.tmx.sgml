ST. PAUL (AP) _ Gov. Jesse Ventura's <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">weekly</TIMEX2> radio show has been
flooded with calls about his new <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">part-time</TIMEX2> job as a football
commentator. 

``You belong to the people, 100 percent, <TIMEX2 val="PT24H" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="XXXX-XX-XX" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">24-hours-<TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a-day</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="P7D" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="XXXX-WXX" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">seven days
<TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a week</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>,'' one caller admonished <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>. Others said his association
with the XFL _ a rough-and-tumble league organized by NBC and the
World Wrestling Federation _ degraded his office. 

Ventura brushed aside the criticism, saying he would stop if the XFL
becomes too raunchy or he deems it in ``any way unacceptable to my
position as governor.'' 

Meanwhile, Democratic state Sen. Ellen Anderson said she would
introduce a bill to make the job of governor a part-time position,
similar to state lawmaker positions. 

``It would fit in (Ventura's) political philosophy and it would take
away the criticism of him taking outside jobs,'' she said. 

In a contract announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-18T20:15:29" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> wrestler agreed to work

He can miss them if
state business demands it.
