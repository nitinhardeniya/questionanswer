Broncos Complain About Sports Bar

DENVER (AP) _ The Denver Broncos and the NFL want a commercial real
estate agent to take down a sign advertising a site for a potential
sports bar because it features the team's name. 

John ``Jack'' Hanlon of Coldwell Banker American Spectrum is listing
an acre of land about a mile from the Broncos' training camp in Dove
Valley. 

Hanlon, a <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">longtime</TIMEX2> Broncos fan, thinks it is the perfect place for a
sports bar and has put up a blue-and-orange sign reading, ``Wanted
Broncos Sports Bar On This Site.'' 

He said that 47,000 cars drive by the site <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">daily</TIMEX2> and ``because the
players have to drive by it <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2> it could become a hangout for
them.'' 

Hanlon said he never has implied that the <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-19T14:10:44" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2> sports bar would be
called the Broncos Bar, but his company has turned over the matter
to its legal department. 

``I thought it would be a good idea to have a bar that would
celebrate the Broncos, emphasizing everything Broncos with pregame
and postgame activities,'' Hanlon said. ``But I couldn't put that on
a 4-by-8 sign.'' 

He said he will do whatever his lawyer advises, but ``I don't think
the Broncos own the word 'Broncos.''' 

NFL lawyer David Proper has given Hanlon until <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Dec. 26</TIMEX2> to remove the
sign. 

In a <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 28</TIMEX2> letter, Proper states ``while we have no objection to
your advertising the property as a location for a sports bar, using
the Broncos' name and colors gives the false impression that the bar
is or can be affiliated with the Broncos.'' 

The land is valued at $650,000 and the bar could cost about $1
million to $1.2 million, Hanlon said.
