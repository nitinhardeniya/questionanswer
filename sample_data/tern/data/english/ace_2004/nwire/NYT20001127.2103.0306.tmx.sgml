WASHINGTON INSIDER AND FAMILY LOYALIST POISED TO BE BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
CHIEF-OF-STAFF &LR; &QL; &UR; By ELAINE SCIOLINO &LR; &QC; &UR; &QL;
c.<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2> N.Y. Times News Service &QC; &QL; &LR; WASHINGTON _ The way
Andrew H. Card Jr. tells it, the first time he ever set eyes on
George W. Bush in Kennebunkport, Maine, in <TIMEX2 val="1979" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1979</TIMEX2>, the younger Bush
cut a most unimpressive profile. &HT; Bush was a defeated politician
who had failed in his bid <TIMEX2 val="1978" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the year before</TIMEX2> to become a congressman
from Texas. And Card, a Republican state legislator from
Massachusetts helping the elder George Bush seek the Republican
nomination for president, was taken aback by the difference between
what he saw as the patrician father and plebeian son.

``I expected to see a Yalie and what I saw was West Texas,'' Card
said in a telephone interview of that first encounter with the
younger George. ``He was wearing cowboy boots and dirty jeans and
was chewing tobacco and it was drooling out of his mouth.'' 

But then, Card spun positive, adding: ``He was sincere, warm and
inviting. I liked him right off the bat because he was a regular,
real person.'' 

Now Card, 53, is the younger Bush's chief-of-staff-in-waiting,
poised to move into a crucial office in the West Wing should Bush be
validated as president. People who have worked with Card over <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the
years</TIMEX2> say that he would bring to the job total loyalty to the
Bushes, a voracious appetite for hard work, a willingness to obey
orders and a manageable ego. 

``He's not a sparkling personality,'' said Brent Scowcroft, the
national security adviser in the Bush administration. ``He's a very
quiet, down-to-earth person. He's a workhorse, not a show dog,
absolutely.'' 

Although Bush campaigned as a Washington outsider independent of his
father's strings, Card is a Washington insider, a corporate lobbyist
for the automobile industry and General Motors who served in both
the Reagan and Bush administrations and enjoys the ultimate trust
not only of Bush but also of his father and mother. 

``I would do anything to help his parents,'' Card said in the
interview. ``They were wonderful to me. I have an infinite amount of
love for them. They took an interest in my wife, the challenges I
went through bringing up my kids. But my respect for Governor Bush
is independent of my love for his parents.'' 

Born in Holbrook, Mass., on <TIMEX2 val="1947-05-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May 10, 1947</TIMEX2>, Card graduated from the
University of South Carolina with a degree in engineering. His wife
of <TIMEX2 val="P33Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">33 years</TIMEX2>, the former Kathleene Bryan, whom he met in the fifth
grade, was ordained as a Methodist minister <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two years ago</TIMEX2>. They have
three grown children and four grandchildren. 

Card's interest in politics began when he became president of the
class of <TIMEX2 val="1965" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1965</TIMEX2> at Holbrook High School. After <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four terms in the state
legislature</TIMEX2>, he ran unsuccessfully for governor in <TIMEX2 val="1982" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1982</TIMEX2>. Then Vice
President George Bush helped land him an unglamorous but respectable
job in the Reagan White House in <TIMEX2 val="1983" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1983</TIMEX2> as liaison with elected state
officials, former Reagan and Bush administration officials said. He
stayed for the rest of the administration. 

``Vice President Bush rarely got involved in personnel matters, but
he really went to bat for Andy Card,'' recalled Chase Untermeyer,
personnel director in the Bush White House. 

After serving as the elder Bush's campaign manager for the crucial
New Hampshire primary in <TIMEX2 val="1988" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1988</TIMEX2>, Card was rewarded with the job of
deputy chief-of-staff in the Bush administration, and then served as
secretary of transportation in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">its final year</TIMEX2>. 

When a hurricane struck Florida <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that year</TIMEX2>, Card was made President
Bush's personal emissary for disaster relief and dispatched there to
dispel the widely held belief that the administration had done too
little too late. He was one of the last people to leave the Bush
administration, staying on until <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two months into the Clinton
administration</TIMEX2> in what was referred to as the ``out-transition
office'' to make sure all the Bush paperwork had been completed. 

In ``Barbara Bush: A Memoir,'' the former first lady referred to
Card as a man who repeatedly ``had come to our rescue.'' 

Card stayed on in Washington, turning himself into the top lobbyist
for the automotive industry. In <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1993</TIMEX2>, he became president and chief
executive of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association,
where he oversaw the lobbying against tighter fuel-economy and air
pollution regulations for automobiles and in coming up with
technical arguments for why industrializing nations should proceed
slowly in addressing global warming. When that organization was
dissolved in <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2>, he became GM's vice president for government
relations in Washington. 

Card prides himself on his humility. When he was offered the job of
running the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia in <TIMEX2 val="2000-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July</TIMEX2>,
he demurred. 

``I told them they had the right to change their mind and asked them
to stop and reflect on it'' in case there were better choices, he
told an interviewer from The Patriot Ledger newspaper in Quincy,
Mass. He said he did not accept the assignment until he consulted
with two other lieutenants from the Bush presidency, former Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State James A. Baker
III. 

As for being offered the job of chief-of-staff-in-waiting, he said
in the telephone interview, ``I'm thrilled, honored, appropriate in
my humility, because I have to stretch to do the job. But I'd rather
stretch than bend over to do it.''
