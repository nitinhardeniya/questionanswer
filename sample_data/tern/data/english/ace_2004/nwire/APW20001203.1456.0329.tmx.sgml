WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. (AP) _ Republican Rep. J.C. Watts joked
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-02TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday night</TIMEX2> that he had revised returns on the presidential
election: ``Al Gore, 9,834 lawsuits. George W. Bush, 7,652.'' 

Watts, chairman of the House Republican Conference, bantered about
the Florida election dispute in a speech prepared for a dinner of
The Gridiron Club at the Greenbrier Hotel. 

``I knew things had really deteriorated when Yasser Arafat offered
to broker a peace between Bush and Gore,'' Watts said. 

The Gridiron Club is an organization of 60 Washington journalists.
Its dinners feature parodies of politics and government, and
humorous speeches by political figures. 

Watts noted that the presidential election of <TIMEX2 val="1876" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1876</TIMEX2> was so disputed
that a congressional commission was created to settle it. ``I didn't
know this until Strom Thurmond told me he cast the deciding vote. 

``Strom will be 98 <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next Tuesday</TIMEX2>,'' Watts said. ``Of course, he was
only 67 when the recount of Florida ballots began.'' 

Watts said he had fond memories of Florida because he was the
quarterback when the University of Oklahoma won the Orange Bowl
there in <TIMEX2 val="1980" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1980</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1981" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1981</TIMEX2>. ``But our victory in <TIMEX2 val="1981" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">'81</TIMEX2> was by a single
point and it was <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1981" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">weeks</TIMEX2> before it was confirmed,'' he said. ``By the
way, I recently learned Al Gore was pulling for Florida State and
demanded a recount.'' 

As is traditional in Gridiron speeches, Watts concluded on a serious
note. ``<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Once-in-a-century</TIMEX2> oddities may leave an election result up
in the air for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a time</TIMEX2>, but the fundamental strength of our democracy
is never in doubt,'' he said. 

``Better a process driven by an army of lawyers than an outrage led
by an army with guns,'' he said.
