CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ <TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nearly 17 months after he first issued his call
for a ``fresh start after <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a season of cynicism</TIMEX2>,''</TIMEX2> Gov. George W.
Bush ended his quest for the presidency <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> on a nearly identical
note, pledging to purge Washington of what he cast as a crippling
discord. 

The course that Bush charted over <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">his final hours on the campaign
trail</TIMEX2>, plotted with as much concern for symbolism as for raw
electoral arithmetic, left no doubt about where he placed the blame
for that atmosphere. His first major rally was in Tennessee and his
last was planned for Arkansas, the home states, respectively, of
Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton. 

The Texas governor's words made equally clear that he saw himself as
the country's best hope for bridging ideological divides, healing
partisan wounds and making sure that Americans could gaze upon the
White House with unfettered respect. 

``There's <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="gave it anchor of today, which is when Bush said this">a better day ahead</TIMEX2> if we have a leader who's willing to
unite the country, to bring people together, to elevate the people's
business above everyday politics,'' Bush said at a rally inside a
hangar at the airport here, where supporters' chants evoked the
nearness of the moment of decision. 

``<TIMEX2 val="P1D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">One more day</TIMEX2>!'' they roared. ``<TIMEX2 val="P1D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">One more day</TIMEX2>!'' 

What the nation needed, Bush told them, was ``a president who can
unite this nation, a president who puts aside the endless partisan
bickering that seems to gridlock our nation's capitol, a president
who puts the people first, a president who lifts this nation's
spirits. 

``I'll be that president,'' he added, a sentence that was equal
parts promise and prediction. It underscored the optimism that Bush
has, from the very beginning, sought to project to voters. 

His schedule over the course of <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a <TIMEX2 val="PT16H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">16-hour</TIMEX2> day</TIMEX2> was also an expression
of that confidence. 

In between Tennessee and Arkansas, his campaign plane touched down
in Wisconsin and Iowa, and while any one of those four states could
wind up providing the key to a Bush victory, none have as many
electoral votes as such battlegrounds as Michigan and Pennsylvania. 

But they are genuine tossups that were initially predicted to be
much more hospitable to Gore. By visiting them <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, Bush
emphasized the breadth of his appeal and the sometimes surprising
vulnerability of the vice president. 

He did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him
from the important business of beseeching supporters to grant him
victory. With <TIMEX2 val="PT24H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">just 24 hours before <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Election Day</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, Bush in many ways
stripped campaigning to its essence: coaxing and cajoling, pleading
and persuading. 

``I want you to understand that I can't win without you,'' Bush told
a crowd of more than 1,000 people at a convention center in Green
Bay, Wis. ``I hope you redouble your efforts to make sure people get
out to the polls.'' 

<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-06TXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Minutes later</TIMEX2>, he added: ``When you go out there and tell the folks
where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to
bringing people together to get things done, and you tell them that
the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in the American
people, I believe it doesn't matter what political party they're in.
They're going to come our way.'' 

In Chattanooga, Bush repeatedly needled Gore, which was much of the
point of going to Tennessee, where Gore is not at all certain to
prevail on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>. 

The Texas governor claimed that Gore's decades of experience in
Washington had estranged him from the rest of the country by making
him too trusting of federal government and too fond of federal
spending. 

``My opponent vows to carry his home state,'' Bush said. ``He may
win Washington, D.C., but he's not going to win Tennessee. 

``He forgot his roots,'' Bush added. ``He forgot where he's from. He
trusts Washington. We trust the people.''
