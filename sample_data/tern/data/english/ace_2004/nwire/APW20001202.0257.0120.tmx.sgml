Koetter Accepts ASU Coaching Job

PHOENIX (AP) _ Boise State coach Dirk Koetter, who just <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day
earlier</TIMEX2> was reportedly headed for Oklahoma State, has agreed to a
contract to coach Arizona State. 

Oklahoma State athletic director Terry Don Phillips confirmed
Koetter's decision in a news release issued <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday night</TIMEX2>. 

``Coach Koetter informed me at <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01T19-06" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">approximately 7 p.m. (CST) tonight</TIMEX2>
that he had been tendered an offer from Arizona State University and
had accepted,'' Phillips said. 

Koetter, 41, replaces Bruce Snyder, who was fired after <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">nine
seasons</TIMEX2>. Snyder will coach Arizona State in a bowl game, most likely
the Las Vegas Bowl. 

The Daily Oklahoman and several TV and radio stations in Oklahoma
had reported <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> that Koetter had accepted the
Oklahoma State job. 

But Phillips never confirmed those reports, and Koetter would not
comment on any job possibilities at Boise State's practice <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>.
Koetter said <TIMEX2 val="2000-W48" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier in the week</TIMEX2> he had interviewed with Phillips
and with Arizona State athletic director Gene Smith. 

Koetter is considered one of the country's top young coaching
prospects. Using an innovative, wide-open offense, he guided Boise
State to a 25-10 record in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three seasons</TIMEX2>. His first team went 6-5,
followed by <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>'s 10-3 record, which included a 34-31 victory
over Louisville in the Humanitarian Bowl. 

<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This year</TIMEX2>'s team is 9-2, with its only losses 38-31 at Arkansas and
42-25 at Washington State. 

Koetter may not have been Arizona State's top choice. 

Phoenix radio station KMVP reported <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> that Smith had quietly
been working on a deal with TCU coach Dennis Franchione that would
have matched the one offered by Alabama. But Franchione apparently
couldn't resist the lure of one of college football's most storied
programs. 

While most of the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-02T03:26:26" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> speculation centered on Koetter, there was
pressure from some Arizona State boosters to hire Danny White, the
<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-02T03:26:26" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Arizona State and Dallas Cowboys quarterback who coaches the
Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League. 

Snyder was fired after his teams went 6-6 <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> and 6-5 <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
season</TIMEX2>.
