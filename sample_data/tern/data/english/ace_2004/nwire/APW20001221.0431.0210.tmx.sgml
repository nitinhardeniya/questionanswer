WASHINGTON (AP) _ President-elect Bush named his nine-member
inaugural committee <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, stacking it with individuals who
helped him raise a record $100 million for his presidential race. 

Fred Meyer, chairman of Victory 2000, the joint effort between the
Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee, was named
chairman of the inaugural committee. 

Four other committee members raised at least $100,000 for Bush's
campaign: Bill DeWitt and Mercer Reynolds, co-chairs of the
Ohio-based investment firm of Reynolds, DeWitt and Company; Brad
Freeman, a California investor; and Florida developer Al Hoffman,
who was finance chairman for Jeb Bush's gubernatorial campaign and
chairman of his inaugural committee. 

Freeman, co-chairman of the RNC gala at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia that raised a record $10.1 million, was
named finance chairman of the inaugural committee. GOP national
committeewoman Julie Finley, another veteran fund-raiser, was named
finance co-chairwoman. 

Jeanne Johnson Phillips of Texas, who has raised money for Bush and
ran his <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2> gubernatorial inauguration, was named executive
director of the inaugural committee. Phillips was deputy chairwoman
of operations for Victory 2000. 

The committee members met <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> with representatives of the
Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to discuss
plans for the <TIMEX2 val="2001-01-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Jan. 20</TIMEX2> ceremony. 

Meanwhile, representatives of several progressive organizations are
making their own plans for <TIMEX2 val="2001-01-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Jan. 20</TIMEX2>: protests against Bush's
positions on such issues as free trade, overhauling the campaign
finance system, the death penalty and the environment. 

The groups hope to infiltrate the crowd at the inauguration and hold
anti-Bush signs aloft, and plan a <TIMEX2 val="P1W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-W03" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">week-long</TIMEX2> series of programs to
highlight their objections to the new administration. 

``Because Bush won, there's more of an interest to protest,'' said
protest coordinator Adam Eidinger, a veteran of demonstrations at
both national political conventions <TIMEX2 val="2000-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this summer</TIMEX2>. ``He needs to
understand that more than half of the American public feels that he
does not represent them.''
