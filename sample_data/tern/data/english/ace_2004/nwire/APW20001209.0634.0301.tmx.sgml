Bush Retreating After Court Setback

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) _ Gov. George W. Bush is retreating to the
solitude of his central Texas ranch after a stunning court setback
in the long drawn-out presidential contest. 

The Texas governor and Republican nominee was described as in good
spirits, but disappointed after <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>'s Florida Supreme Court order
for an immediate recount of so-called undervotes missed in machine
tallies. 

The dispirited Bush camp had hoped for a victory celebration in the
streets of Austin <TIMEX2 val="2000-W49-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this weekend</TIMEX2>. 

Instead, Bush and his wife, Laura, were headed back <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> to the
isolated 1,600-acre ranch about a <TIMEX2 val="PT2H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two-hour</TIMEX2> drive north of here,
where he has spent <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="partitive">much of his time</TIMEX2> since the election. 

No public appearances were planned throughout <TIMEX2 val="P1WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W49-WE" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">the weekend</TIMEX2>. And,
unlike other recent Bush visits to the ranch near Waco, Texas, no
plans were made to bring reporters out for picture-taking sessions
with prominent visitors or would-be members of a Bush Cabinet. 

``We've run out of reaction,'' Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday night</TIMEX2>. ``Obviously, everybody was disappointed.'' 

Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman in the Bush-Cheney transition
headquarters in McLean, Va., called the development ``just another
dip in the roller coaster.'' 

But Bush officials did little to hide their obvious dismay with
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>'s 4-3 state Supreme Court ruling favoring Democrat Al Gore. 

Republicans were briefly buoyed by a pair of court rulings on
absentee ballots that went in Bush's favor in Seminole and Martin
counties <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier Friday</TIMEX2>. But the upbeat mood quickly evaporated with
the state Supreme Court ruling. 

``Obviously, (Bush) was a good bit happier after the Seminole and
Martin decisions than he was after this 4-3 decision,'' said James
A. Baker III, the head of Bush's legal team and a former secretary
of state. 

Still, he added, ``Governor Bush is in fine spirits and quite
prepared to see this through to its ultimate conclusion because he
feels very confidently that he has won this election and won it more
than one time.'' 

Bush went on with a party at the governor's mansion for his staff
and his Secret Service detail <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday evening</TIMEX2>. 

Even before the court setback, Bush was more muted <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> than he
has been in <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-08" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">days</TIMEX2>, perhaps reflecting an understanding gleaned from
his lawyers that the Florida high court could rule against him. 

``We're prepared, if need be, to take our case back to the (U.S.)
Supreme Court,'' he told reporters. 

As to whether the trailing candidate should concede the race rather
than prolong the process in the courts, Bush said, ``Each candidate
is going to have to decide to make the decision that's best for the
country.'' 

As news of <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>'s ruling spread, pro-Gore demonstrators began to
congregate outside the governor's mansion. 

They were then matched by supporters of Bush and running mate Dick
Cheney. Car horns blared and at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">times</TIMEX2> competing demonstrators
shouted at one another. 

By <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-08TNI" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">nightfall</TIMEX2>, however, the demonstrators had all left and the
mansion was quiet _ even though the party was going on inside.
