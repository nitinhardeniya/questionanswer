TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) _ Tornadoes destroyed homes and overturned
cars in several areas of Alabama on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> and more than two dozen
people were reported injured. 

At least one person was killed in Tuscaloosa, said Debbie Watson,
spokeswoman for the Tuscaloosa County Emergency Management Agency. 

Twisters struck just before <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-16T12:00" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">noon</TIMEX2> in the state's rural southeastern
corner, then hit Tuscaloosa and the northern part of the state as
lines of thunderstorms swept across the South. 

The Tuscaloosa twister struck a subdivision, Watson said. The
National Weather Service said there was extensive damage. Twenty-one
people were injured, according to broadcast reports. 

Another tornado hit Geneva, near the Alabama-Florida line, said
Mayor Warren Beck. He said vehicles were overturned and homes were
destroyed. 

Geneva County Emergency Management Agency director Margaret Mixon
said eight people were injured, two of them severely. 

That tornado also damaged about a half-dozen homes in Dale County,
destroying a peanut mill at Abbeville and damaging a textile mill,
authorities said. 

Dale County Commissioner Buddy Stapleton said he counted about a
half-dozen homes hit near Newton. 

In northern Alabama, about eight homes were reported destroyed and
trees and power lines were toppled in Limestone County.
