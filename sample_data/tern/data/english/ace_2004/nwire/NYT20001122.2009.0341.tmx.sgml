SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ ``There was a coldness in Ward C,'' the
prosecutor began his wintry tale of white-coated murder <TIMEX2 val="2000-W47" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2>. 

``It was a deep, eerie, unsettling feeling that something terribly,
terribly wrong was happening,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney William
Welch II went on. Patients were succumbing to sudden cardiac arrest
at an alarming and suspicious rate. Finally, he said, in <TIMEX2 val="1996-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">February
1996</TIMEX2>, ``three registered nurses came forward to report a patient's,
a health care professional's, a hospital's worst nightmare: There
was a killer amongst them.'' 

That killer, prosecutors charge, is Kristen Gilbert, 33, a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-22T20:58:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2>
nurse, who is on trial in federal court here, accused of murdering
four patients and trying to kill three others by poisoning them with
epinephrine, a stimulant that sent their hearts racing out of
control. 

Massachusetts is one of 12 states that lack the death penalty, but
Gilbert's is a capital case nonetheless, because the alleged crimes
occurred on federal property _ the Veterans Affairs Medical Center
in Northampton, Mass. And so the case is being tried in federal
court, where prosecutors can, and say they will, seek the death
penalty. 

In an opening argument on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, the defense lawyer, David P.
Hoose, emphasized that no one had seen Gilbert poison the patients.
He said that the patients were very sick and that the prosecution's
claims that evidence of epinephrine poisoning was found in the
exhumed bodies of patients were based on shoddy science. 

The case is really about ``an investigation that started with a
conclusion and then worked backwards to fill in the gaps,'' he said.
``And the proposition they started with was that people were
injected with epinephrine, and Kristen Gilbert did it.'' 

As Welch depicted her, Gilbert reveled in the excitement and
attention of the emergency calls made whenever a life-threatening
situation arose, and went out of her way to create emergencies by
injecting patients with epinephrine. 

She had a particular reason to crave that spotlight, he said: Though
married and the mother of two boys, she began an affair in <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late 1995</TIMEX2>
with one of the hospital's security police, James Perrault, and he
would be summoned to help whenever an emergency call was made. 

Welch also said Gilbert had confessed to Perrault, who would
testify. 

Welch described a pivotal moment on <TIMEX2 val="1996-02-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Feb. 15, 1996</TIMEX2>, when a suspicious
colleague of Gilbert's, Kathy Rix, counted three ampules in the
intensive care unit's medicine cabinet at <TIMEX2 val="1996-02-15T16:00" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">4 p.m.</TIMEX2>; <TIMEX2 val="1996-02-15T17:00" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">an hour later</TIMEX2>,
after an emergency call that involved Gilbert, she counted again and
found none, and then saw three broken ampules in the needle disposal
bucket. 

``She felt sick to her stomach and her knees about buckled,'' Welch
said, ``because she <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-02-15T17:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> knew what had been happening on Ward C.''
