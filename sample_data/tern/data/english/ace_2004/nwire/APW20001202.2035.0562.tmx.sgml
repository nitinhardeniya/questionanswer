Skepticism Greets Fox's Border Plan 
</HEADLINE>

BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) _ In speech after speech, Mexico President
Vicente Fox argues for his dream: A free flow of workers across an
open border, an international boundary that ceases to be a barrier. 

But the 2,000-mile frontier between Mexico and the United States is
delineated by steel walls and barbed wire, watched over by uniformed
guards from the Border Patrol. 

``It will never happen,'' Rosalinda Arebalo of neighboring
Matamoros, Mexico, said flatly of Fox's dream. ``If it did, it would
be a miracle.'' 

If anything, the border is closing down. The United States announced
plans <TIMEX2 val="2000-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this fall</TIMEX2> to step up border security with 1,300 miles of road
and fence, cameras and thousands of portable floodlights. From <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1993</TIMEX2>
through <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1999</TIMEX2>, the number of Border Patrol agents doubled from 4,000
to 8,000. 

``I'll be honest, your country isn't ready for it,'' said Fernando
Kleinfingher, a computer consultant in Tijuana, Mexico. ``It would
be very hard for America to accept.'' 

``The United States will never allow an open border,'' predicted
Faustino Avalos, a <TIMEX2 val="P65Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">65-year-old</TIMEX2> farmer strolling home to Matamoros.
``They only want Mexicans to visit and buy things. The undocumented
workers get nothing but injustice.'' 

Economists say the skepticism is well-founded. 

``It's a totally unrealistic proposal,'' said Steve Bronars, a
professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin. ``It's
just not something that's going to happen.'' 

Fox, who was sworn into office <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, first pledged to open the
border during a heated campaign to overturn the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party. Pressed for details after his <TIMEX2 val="2000-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July</TIMEX2> election,
the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-02T20:59:26" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Coca-Cola executive revised his scheme, promising to
bring Mexican wages up to U.S. standards and open the border within
<TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">10 years</TIMEX2>, although he remains vague about a schedule. 

Economists say an unfettered flow of Mexican workers could drive
wages down and strain social services to the breaking point,
particularly in border states. 

On top of that, adds El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez: ``There are
safety issues of drugs, terrorists and contraband.'' 

President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were noncommittal in
<TIMEX2 val="2000-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2> meetings with Fox. And Texas Gov. George W. Bush said he
supported ``a humane way'' of cracking down on migration from ``our
friendly neighbor to the south.'' 

``I appreciate (Fox's) optimistic vision,'' Bush said. 

Mark Krikorian, director of the nonpartisan, Washington-based Center
for Immigration Studies, believes Fox's call for an open border is a
``bargaining chip.'' Fox will demand a porous boundary and then
settle for an increase in legal migration, he predicted. 

``He's hoping the United States will split the difference,''
Krikorian said. 

It's <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a good time</TIMEX2> to cut a deal. U.S. unemployment is at its lowest
in <TIMEX2 val="P3DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">three decades</TIMEX2> and there are fewer people to fill low-skilled jobs
in farms, restaurants and factories. 

That scenario rings familiar to Arebalo, 49, who went from Matamoros
to North Carolina to work in soybean fields when she was a girl. Her
family needed the money and the farms needed the help. 

Those were <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the days of the Bracero Program, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">World War II-era</TIMEX2>
legislation that beckoned thousands of Mexican nationals to
replenish a dwindling U.S. labor pool</TIMEX2>. 

In <TIMEX2 val="1954" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1954</TIMEX2>, a military-style Immigration and Naturalization Service
campaign called ``Operation Wetback'' drove about 1 million illegal
immigrants back into Mexico. <TIMEX2 val="1964" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Ten years later</TIMEX2>, the Bracero Program
fizzled out. 

``<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1954" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">Back then</TIMEX2> it was simple to get papers to work here, and you could
just come across,'' Arebalo said as she stepped off the
international bridge into Brownsville's shopping district. ``But
<TIMEX2 val="1954" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">then</TIMEX2> everything changed.''
