JERUSALEM _ The commander of Israeli troops in the West Bank said
there was a simple goal to the helicopter assassination on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>
of a gun-wielding local Palestinian leader. 

``I hope it will reduce the violence and bring back reason to this
area,'' Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Eitan told reporters at a briefing <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-09TXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">hours
after three missiles fired from an Apache helicopter killed Hussein
Obaiyat, along with two middle-aged women standing near his van in
Beit Sahur, near Bethlehem</TIMEX2>. 

Instead, it has touched off <TIMEX2 val="2000-W45-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">one of the bloodiest and most intense
weekends of fighting yet in the <TIMEX2 val="P6W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W45" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">six-week-old</TIMEX2> conflict</TIMEX2>, with gunfire
crackling through the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 

Five Palestinians and an Israeli soldier were shot dead on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>.
Gunfire between Palestinian positions and Israeli areas continued
through <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-10TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the night</TIMEX2> around Ramallah and Bethlehem, and by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-11TNI" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">nightfall on
Saturday</TIMEX2> more Palestinians were dead and an Israeli soldier
critically wounded, raising the death toll to at least 200. 

Indeed, the escalation of gunfire is being described by both
Palestinians and Israelis as a ``Lebanonization'' of the conflict to
a state resembling guerrilla war. 

Two Palestinians were killed as they staged a drive-by ambush on an
Israeli jeep in the Gaza Strip near the Israeli settlement of Gush
Katif <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-11TAF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX2>, and two Israeli soldiers were wounded, one
critically. As the Israelis retrieved and held on to the two bodies,
a large crowd of Palestinians gathered. Men in civilian clothes in
the crowd began firing with AK-47 assault rifles and a <TIMEX2 val="PT45M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-11TAF" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">45-minute</TIMEX2> gun
battle broke out. 

The situation remained tense as <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-11TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">dusk</TIMEX2> fell, with an army helicopter
hovering overhead as Palestinian police evacuated their post for
fear it would be attacked by rockets. 

The clashes started early in Gaza. A <TIMEX2 val="P12Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">12-year-old</TIMEX2> Palestinian boy was
shot dead when troops opened fire on a crowd of stone throwers near
the Erez checkpoint. In Jenin, on the West Bank, a Palestinian
identified as Hani Marzouq, 37, died in a hospital from neck and
chest wounds suffered in the widespread clashes on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>. 

In Hebron, thousands of mourners crowded the streets for the funeral
of Raed Mohtaseb, 27, chanting ``the blood of the martyrs is calling
us.'' 

Mohtaseb was shot while riding in a car driven by his father, Saedi
Mohtaseb, who is a senior official in Yasser Arafat's Fatah
organization in the tense, embattled city where a handful of Jewish
settlers are surrounded by Palestinian residents who have been kept
under frequent curfew. The Palestinians charge that the shooting was
an attempt to assassinate a Palestinian official. 

The army issued a statement saying it ``denies any attempt to
assassinate a Fatah member or a senior official of the Palestinian
authority.'' 

An American news photographer, Yola Monakhov, was shot and wounded
by Israeli troops while covering a stone-throwing confrontation at
Rachel's Tomb, near Bethlehem, Palestinian hospital officials said.
Monakhov, a <TIMEX2 val="P26Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">26-year-old</TIMEX2> free-lancer on assignment for The Associated
Press, suffered a fractured pelvis, hospital officials said. 

The assassination of the once-relatively obscure Fatah leader
Obaiyat, whom the army blamed particularly for leading nocturnal
shooting on Gilo, a neighborhood in southeastern Jerusalem, was
regarded as a grave step by Israeli commentators. 

Writing in the newspaper Haaretz before <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>'s marked increase in
Palestinian gunfire, Amir Oren described the strike as ``a critical
point, almost a point of no return, in the scale of violence.'' 

In Yedioth Ahronoth, Roni Shaked wrote: ``The use of helicopter
missiles as a tool of assassination is a step on the way to the
`Lebanonization' of the territories.'' 

Shaked added: ``In <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-10" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the short term</TIMEX2> _ and this was also the assessment
of the General Staff _ the Palestinians will step up their
hostilities in response to the slaying. But the army believes in the
long run such proactive operations will lead to a decrease in
terrorism.'' 

The surge in violence came as Prime Minister Ehud Barak prepared for
a meeting on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> with President Clinton in Washington. But no one
here seemed to be holding out hopes that the meeting would bring
calm soon. 

Barak said on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, before much of Israel closed down for <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
Sabbath</TIMEX2>, that the talks would be an effort to end the violence, but
added he did not expect they would ``lead to a renewal of
negotiations.'' 

With the <TIMEX2 val="P7Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">seven-year-old</TIMEX2> peace process in tatters, one senior
Palestinian figure, Parliament speaker Ahmed Korei, known as Abu
Ala, insisted that Israel must halt all settlement building, accept
an international peacekeeping force to protect Palestinians and
allow the United Nations a role in the peace process, before talks
could be resumed. 

These are conditions that are anathema to the Israelis and are
unlikely to be met.
