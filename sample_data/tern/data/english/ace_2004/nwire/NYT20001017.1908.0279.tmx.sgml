A federal judge in Delaware, in a decision made public on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>,
held that one company's corporate tax shelter was a sham and noted
that 85 other large corporations used the same deduction to avoid
paying $6 billion in corporate income taxes. 

U.S. District Court Judge Murray Schwartz in Wilmington, Del., ruled
that Camelot Music could not deduct interest on loans it took out
against life insurance on its 1,430 employees in <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2> through <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1993</TIMEX2>.
Camelot Music is owned by Trans World Entertainment, which bought
the company <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> for $451.9 million. 

The decision could affect many of the other 85 companies, which the
judge did not identify by name, because his ruling applies to every
company organized in Delaware, whose corporate-governance laws have
made it a major center for large companies to have their nominal
headquarters. 

American Electric Power, an electric utility in Columbus, Ohio, has
a case involving almost identical issues scheduled to go to trial in
<TIMEX2 val="2000-W44" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two weeks</TIMEX2>. Pat D. Hemlepp, a spokesman for the company, said that
$240 million in taxes were at issue. 

Camelot took out life insurance from the Hartford Group beginning in
<TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2> on its 1,430 workers. The company paid for the insurance,
taking a deduction for this expense, and then borrowed back the
premium through a loan against the insurance policy. On its
corporate income tax returns the company took $13.8 million of
deductions in <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2> through <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1993</TIMEX2> tax returns for interest it paid on
the loans. 

Schwartz said that there was no build up in the cash value of the
insurance policies and because of the way the loans were structured
there was no reasonable prospect that the company would profit from
buying the insurance. 

He called the arrangement ``a factual sham'' that ``lacked objective
economic substance and a subjective business purpose other than the
tax benefits flowing from the interest deductions.'' 

The judge said the deal ``crossed the line'' on permissible
deductions by such a wide margin that the Internal Revenue Service
was right to impose penalties for filing in an inaccurate tax
return. 

John Sullivan, Trans World Entertainment's chief financial officer,
said that if the decision stood it would cost the company about $8
million plus interest. ``I'm surprised by the ruling,'' Sullivan
said, adding that he expected the company would appeal the decision. 

The Camelot Music and American Electric Power cases are similar to
the corporate-owned life insurance policy tax shelter of Winn-Dixie
Stores, a big supermarket chain, that a tax court judge demolished
<TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> in an 81-page opinion.
