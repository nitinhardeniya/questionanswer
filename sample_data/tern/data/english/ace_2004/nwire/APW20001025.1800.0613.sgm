Ravens' Dilfer Prepares for Chance 
</HEADLINE>

OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) _ The hardship and disappointment he endured
during his most frustrating NFL season has made Trent Dilfer a wiser
man and a better quarterback. 

Dilfer, who started 76 games for Tampa Bay from 1994 to 1999, will
get his first start with the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. He has been
given the job of reviving a struggling offense that hasn't produced
a touchdown in four games. 

It may take Dilfer a while to adjust to the speed of the game, and
his right arm could very well be a little rusty during the first
quarter against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 

Mentally, however, he should be in prime form. 

``I have prepared all year as if I was the starter. That is the way
you have to be as a backup, in order to be ready,'' Dilfer said.
``My routine won't change a whole lot. My focus won't change because
I am very focused.'' 

Dilfer signed with the Ravens as a free agent in March, knowing that
his job would be nothing more than serving as an emergency
replacement for Tony Banks. He realized that his credentials _
Dilfer ranked fourth in touchdown passes and winning percentage
among starting NFL quarterbacks from 1997-99 _ were irrelevant. 

He simply could have gone through the motions, but instead showed up
for work on his day off and was always one of the last to leave the
practice field. 

His determination stemmed from his most difficult season as a
professional. 

Last season, Dilfer lost his starting job in October, then was
forced back into the lineup after his replacement was injured.
Dilfer then guided the Bucs to four straight wins in November before
a fractured right clavicle ended his season. 

``I think the two hardest things that I have had to deal with in my
career were being benched on a permanent basis and watching
throughout the whole playoffs,'' he said. 

His fall from grace altered his perspective. 

``When I got benched last year, the big thing was for me to figure
out what I was going to do next,'' Dilfer said. ``When I came back,
I thought I played some of the best football in my career because I
just let go. I said to myself that I have failed already, so what is
there to be scared of?'' 

That's the attitude he will bring into the huddle Sunday against the
Steelers, who are suddenly pressing the Ravens for second place in
the AFC Central. 

Starting the season behind Banks, Dilfer didn't play the role of a
disgruntled backup or an uninterested veteran. 

Instead, he quickly made himself a part of the team. 

``He has been as good as a man can be in that situation,'' Ravens
coach Brian Billick said. ``He has actively been a part of what we
are doing since he got here, whether it's sitting in the room
discussing defenses with (rookie quarterback) Chris Redman or doing
a play checklist with Tony. It's a tough job for a backup to stay
mentally tough, and you can't ask for much more than what he has
done.'' 

The only other thing the Ravens are asking from Dilfer is a
touchdown. Baltimore hasn't reached the end zone in October and has
lost two straight games despite owning the top-ranked defense in the
AFC. 

``We're struggling offensively and we need to get jump-started,''
Dilfer said. ``You've got to love the challenge. This game is all
about facing challenges, and conquering them.''
