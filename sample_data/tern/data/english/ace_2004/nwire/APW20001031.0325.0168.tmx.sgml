Japan's Central Bank Expects Growth

TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's central bank on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> forecast strong
economic growth of between 1.9 percent and 2.3 percent for <TIMEX2 val="FY2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
current fiscal year</TIMEX2> _ a prediction far more optimistic than the
government's expectations. 

In a wide-ranging report on the outlook for the troubled economy,
the Bank of Japan policy board said the country would continue a
gradual private demand-led recovery over <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next</TIMEX2>. 

The bank said, however, that the ``pace of recovery in personal
consumption will be slow'' because it will take time for the
improvement in the corporate sector to filter through to the
household sector. 

Despite those reservations, the BOJ's outlook for <TIMEX2 val="FY2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the fiscal year
ending <TIMEX2 val="2001-03-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next March 31</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> was far rosier than the government's. The
Economic Planning Agency has forecast growth in gross domestic
product at 1.5 percent. 

The optimistic report comes as Japan is struggling to emerge from
its worst economic downturn since World War II. The economy is
beginning to grow, but private demand is lagging behind the
corporate recovery. 

Unemployment continues to be a problem. The government announced on
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> that the jobless rate had edged up to 4.7 percent in
<TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September</TIMEX2>. The rate was at 4.6 percent in <TIMEX2 val="2000-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2>, after hitting a
postwar record high of 4.9 percent in <TIMEX2 val="2000-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">February</TIMEX2>. 

In its report <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-31" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>, the BOJ predicted that corporate capital
investment will increase over <TIMEX2 val="P12M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next 12 months</TIMEX2>, especially in
information and communications-related sectors. 

The forecast also included projections on prices. The BOJ said the
core consumer price index, which excludes fresh food prices, would
fall from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent. The forecasts reflected a
range of opinion among the board members, with the lowest and
highest predictions excluded. 

Despite the strong growth forecast, the BOJ said problems still
lingered in the economy. 

Slow spending, coupled with structural problems such as corporate
restructuring and balance sheet problems, will mean ``the expansion
of the economy is unlikely to be vigorous'' the BOJ board noted. 

Higher oil prices were another problem. The BOJ board said that
while they won't have much direct impact on the Japanese economy for
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-31T03:44:23" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the time being</TIMEX2>, they could give rise to inflation in other
countries, potentially affecting Japan. 

The board said that while restructuring at companies and financial
institutions might ``lay the foundation for economic growth over <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-31T03:44:23" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the
medium</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-31T03:44:23" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">long term</TIMEX2>,'' in <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-31T03:44:23" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the short term</TIMEX2> such moves could ``further
adversely affect the economy.'' 

In the financial sector, the board said that bank lending was
expected to stay sluggish.
