Jeff Zucker, the <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">longtime</TIMEX2> executive producer of NBC's ``Today''
program, will be named <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> as the new president of NBC's
entertainment division, replacing Garth Ancier, NBC executives said. 

The move will have a ripple effect on two NBC divisions, forcing the
network to replace Zucker at ``Today,'' where he has led the program
to its most dominant ratings position in <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="200" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">decades</TIMEX2>, and shaking up the
entertainment division, where Zucker has never worked. 

Zucker's enormous success at ``Today,'' where he has served as
executive producer since <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>, has for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">several years</TIMEX2> set him up for
a promotion at the network, and he has frequently expressed his
desire to move on from ``Today.'' 

On <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-12TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday night</TIMEX2>, Zucker said that after covering the postelection
news on ``Today'' and seeing that story help establish <TIMEX2 val="PT1H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the third
hour of the program, which was only added in <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, he had little
left to accomplish at ``Today.'' 

But no job in the news division had either been available or of
interest to Zucker. The move to NBC Entertainment serves as the best
way for NBC to retain an executive they regard as one of the best in
television. 

The decision abruptly ends Ancier's leadership of NBC Entertainment
after <TIMEX2 val="P18M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">only 18 months</TIMEX2>. His tenure became extremely troubled <TIMEX2 val="2000-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this fall</TIMEX2>
after the new lineup of NBC series stumbled badly. But the move's
timing is still somewhat surprising because NBC had enough strength
among its core group of hit shows to win <TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2>'s ratings sweep
competition. 

In addition, three series _ ``The West Wing,'' ``Law and Order
S.V.U.'' and ``Third Watch'' _ all added <TIMEX2 val="1999-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last fall</TIMEX2>, Ancier's first
at NBC, have since become significant hits for the network. 

But Ancier's ouster had been the subject of widespread rumors in
Hollywood in <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2004-W25" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last several weeks</TIMEX2>, largely because of the failure
of <TIMEX2 val="2000-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this fall</TIMEX2>'s slate of programs. NBC has several aging hits,
including ``Frasier'' and ``Friends,'' that may not have <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">many more
years on the network</TIMEX2>, and NBC executives have said <TIMEX2 val="2000-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this fall</TIMEX2> that it
was especially crucial the network add some new replacements. 

Only one NBC show, ``Ed,'' has performed with any particular
promise, although two others, ``DAG' and ``Cursed,'' have proved at
least serviceable in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time periods where they are protected by other
NBC hits</TIMEX2>. 

But many other new NBC series <TIMEX2 val="2000-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this fall</TIMEX2> collapsed quickly, including
two high-profile shows, ``The Michael Richards Show'' and
``Titans.'' Ancier was especially tied to the latter, having argued
strenuously for it <TIMEX2 val="2000-SP" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last spring</TIMEX2> before NBC selected its schedule. The
show had been opposed by several other senior NBC executives,
including the network president, Bob Wright, on grounds that it was
tasteless. Ancier had dismissed that criticism. 

Ancier was also the target of some criticism from Wright <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>
after CBS, with ``Survivor,'' and ABC, with ``Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire,'' turned their networks around with so-called reality
programs. Wright questioned why NBC Entertainment was the only
network that had not picked up programs in the reality genre. 

Ancier had come to NBC with seemingly ideal qualifications. He had
previously worked at NBC Entertainment, then had run Fox's
programming in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="this val is taking this expression a bit too literally">the first days of that network</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-14T19:04:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">most recently</TIMEX2> had
managed programming at the WB Network, helping that network
establish itself as a strong competitor for young audiences.
