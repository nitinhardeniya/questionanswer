When David Cone heard about the Mets filling out their pitching
rotation <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> _ and ending their interest in signing him _ he was
already considering a proposition to work as a late-inning reliever
for the Kansas City Royals. 

Cone, the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T22:35:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Yankees right-hander, received a telephone call
<TIMEX2 val="2000-12-10TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday night</TIMEX2> from his <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-11T22:35:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> teammate George Brett, currently vice
president for baseball operations with the Royals. He asked Cone if
he would be interested in being a setup man or a closer for Kansas
City. 

``It's intriguing,'' Cone said. ``It got me thinking. I have to give
it some thought, because I've been a starter.'' 

Cone, a Kansas City native, was originally signed by the Royals and
broke into the majors with the team. 

The Mets had little contact with Cone's agent before they signed the
pitchers Kevin Appier and Steve Trachsel on <TIMEX2 val="2000-12-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>. ``I wish I
would've had a chance to talk to them face to face,'' said Cone, who
believes his options will become clearer after the <TIMEX2 val="2000-WI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="or should this be 2001-WI? The meetings seem to be going on now, so it seemed odd to use the rule of using the Jan-March year for a winter.">winter</TIMEX2> meetings
are over. 

The Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles are among the other teams
expressing interest in Cone.
