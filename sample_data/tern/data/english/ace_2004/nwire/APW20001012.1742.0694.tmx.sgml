WARREN, Mich. (AP) _ A drug suspect being booked at police
headquarters shot a veteran detective to death and then turned the
gun on himself. 

Ljeka Juncaj, 29, pulled a gun out of his pants <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday night</TIMEX2> and
shot Detective Christopher Wouters during a struggle, Police Chief
James Vohs said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>. 

Juncaj, arrested as part of an undercover bust, then shot himself in
the head. Both men died later at a hospital. 

Juncaj was accused of possession with intent to deliver 400 pills of
the drug ecstasy. 

Vohs said other officers took part in the arrest but he didn't know
what steps had been taken to search Juncaj for a weapon. Ordinarily,
officers said, a suspect would have been frisked at least once
before arriving at booking. 

Wouters, 42, was a <TIMEX2 val="P19Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">19-year</TIMEX2> veteran, and he and his wife had three
young children. 

``A part of us died <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-11TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last night</TIMEX2>,'' said Sgt. Kevin Sommers, who had
known Wouters since they were children. ``You couldn't ask for a
better guy, a better friend, a better officer.'' 

It was the first time since <TIMEX2 val="1969" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1969</TIMEX2> that an officer has been killed in
the line of duty in Warren, a large blue-collar Detroit suburb.
