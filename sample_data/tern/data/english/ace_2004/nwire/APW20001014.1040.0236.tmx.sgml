General Assembly To Hold Meeting

UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly is expected to hold an
emergency meeting <TIMEX2 val="2000-W42" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next week</TIMEX2> on the Middle East to consider a
resolution that would condemn ``excessive use of force'' by Israeli
soldiers, according to a draft obtained by The Associated Press. 

The draft is stronger than the resolution adopted by the Security
Council <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last Saturday</TIMEX2>, but the wording was softer on Israel compared
to <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-14T10:41:12" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="does this really mean 'previous'? which we don't mark.">past</TIMEX2> resolutions on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. 

The draft supports continued negotiations in search of peace and
takes no side on divisive issues such as Jerusalem, saying only that
the holy places there must be respected. It also takes into account
the security needs of both Israelis and Palestinians and expresses
deep concern about casualties on both sides. 

Arab states and developing nations asked for the emergency meeting
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> after the Security Council indicated it did not want another
contentious session while diplomatic efforts were under way to end
the violence that cost the lives of 96 people, most Palestinians. 

With a majority of the 189 U.N. member states <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-14T10:41:12" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> supporting a
special session on the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-14T10:41:12" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> unrest, an emergency meeting is
virtually certain. 

Spokeswoman Sue Markham said General Assembly President Harri
Holkeri will consult with other member states on the request and
Arab diplomats said a meeting is likely to be held <TIMEX2 val="2000-W42" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early next week</TIMEX2>. 

The Palestinian representative, Nasser Al-Kidwa, had originally
requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council to adopt a
new resolution, saying Israeli rocket attacks on Palestinian command
centers <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> _ retaliation for the brutal lynching of two
Israeli soldiers _ were ``tantamount to the declaration of an
overall war against the entire Palestinian people.'' 

But U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said the United States would
veto any new resolution and other council members said they wanted
to give Secretary-General Kofi Annan <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">time to negotiate a truce</TIMEX2>
before taking any new action. The two sides announced <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> they
would hold a summit in Egypt. 

Security Council resolutions have more clout because they are
legally binding. General Assembly resolutions are adopted by
majority vote and cannot be vetoed, but are not legally binding. 

The Security Council resolution <TIMEX2 val="2000-W40" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="last week's Saturday, according to the context">last week</TIMEX2> condemned the ``excessive
use of force'' against the Palestinians _ without naming Israel. The
General Assembly draft resolution would condemn ``the excessive use
of force by the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinian
civilians.'' Israel says its soldiers use live ammunition only when
their lives are in danger. 

The proposed draft reiterates that Jewish settlements in territory
captured in the <TIMEX2 val="1967" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1967</TIMEX2> Mideast war ``are illegal,'' and an obstacle to
peace. 

The Security Council resolution backed ``a speedy and objective
inquiry'' into the fighting. The proposed General Assembly
resolution strongly supports ``a mechanism of inquiry'' into the
events and asks Annan to report to the assembly in <TIMEX2 val="P10D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-07" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="dated from the Oct 7 resolution">10 days</TIMEX2> on his
efforts to establish such a mechanism.
