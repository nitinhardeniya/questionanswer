RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi air force helicopter crashed
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, killing all seven people on board, including three officers,
the Defense Ministry said. 

The European-made Cougar crashed while it was trying to land at
Qassim airport in northern Saudi Arabia, said a ministry official in
a report issued by the official Saudi Press Agency. 

Bad weather caused the helicopter to crash, the report said. It did
not mention an earlier statement by a Saudi official that the
helicopter had caught fire before it crashed. 

The helicopter took off from a military base in al-Kharj in central
Saudi Arabia to rescue a flood victim in the area, he said. 

Meanwhile, a Saudi official speaking on condition of anonymity said
a British-made Tornado fighter plane belonging to the Saudi air
force crashed in Beesha in southwestern Saudi Arabia on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>. 

He said that both the pilot and co-pilot were able to parachute out
before the crash. The cause of that crash was not immediately known.
