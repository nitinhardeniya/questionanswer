When Sante and Kenneth Kimes _ the hand-holding, mother-and-son
grifter team _ were sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P125Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">125 years</TIMEX2> in <TIMEX2 val="2000-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June</TIMEX2>, it seemed like
the end of a surreal string of crimes that culminated in the murder
of an elderly Upper East Side socialite. But <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>, during a
prison interview, Kimes took a Court TV reporter hostage for <TIMEX2 val="PT4H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-10" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">four
hours</TIMEX2>, holding a pen to her neck. 

Kimes, 25, was being interviewed by Maria Zone, 35, a freelance
producer for the documentary series ``Crime Stories,'' at the
Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York. The interview
began <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-10T10:00" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about 10 a.m.</TIMEX2>, officials at the State Department of
Correctional Services said. During a break at <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-10T14:15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2:15</TIMEX2>, the officials
said, Kimes went across the visiting room to use the bathroom while
Zone headed in the opposite direction to a vending machine. 

When she returned, he ``pushed a pen against her neck, wrapped his
other arm around her shoulder and pulled them both to the floor,''
according to a statement from the department. He ordered the only
other people in the room, the cameraman and the sound operator, to
``back off.'' 

The two men, Drew Harty and Jeremy Drowne, left the room, and prison
negotiators and guards entered. 

Kimes' main demand was that his mother not be extradited to
California, where the two face the death penalty on charges they
killed a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-10T22:53:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> business associate. 

During the negotiation, Kimes removed the pen from Zone's throat,
officials said. Eventually, the negotiators distracted him long
enough for other officials to wrestle him to the ground, Jim
Flateau, a correctional services spokesman told Court TV. 

Zone escaped the incident with minor injuries, and Kimes was moved
to the prison's disciplinary housing unit, the authorities said. He
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-10T22:53:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> faces criminal charges in the incident. 

Zone had interviewed Kimes before, said Carolyn Kresky, the
executive producer of ``Crime Stories,'' and found him mild-mannered
and intelligent. ``You kind of wondered, how did he end up in this
situation, in prison for the rest of his life?'' Kresky said. 

But Kimes was under pressure, with his extradition to California
imminent. 

``I just got off the phone with one of his mother's lawyers, who
said to me, `Maybe he realizes <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-10T22:53:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> he's never going to be free, and
reality has set in,''' said Jeanne King, a reporter whose book about
the Kimeses, ``Dead End,'' will be published by M. Evans &AMP; Co.
<TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2>. 

In <TIMEX2 val="2000-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2>, Kimes was interviewed for an article in the <TIMEX2 val="2000-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">November</TIMEX2>
issue of Details magazine. In <TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="MID" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">mid-September</TIMEX2>, he sent two letters to
the editor in chief, asking for the writer, Kevin Gray, to interview
him again, said a spokeswoman for the magazine. 

``I truly must see Kevin again and soon,'' he wrote, promising new
evidence, including a tape that ``absolutely proves me and my
mother's innocence.'' 

Gray said that although he had interviewed Kimes in person three
times, the inmate refused to tell him the new information over the
phone and insisted that he come again in person. 

But he said that Kimes was not intimidating in person. ``It's not
unlike talking to a manipulative teenager,'' Gray said. ``He's a
conniver. He wants you to believe his story.'' 

Correction Officer Tyler Smith, the acting chief steward for the
union representing officers, called the hostage incident ``very,
very unusual.'' 

Still, he said that officers had long felt that the visiting room
procedure was unsafe and allowed drugs and contraband to enter the
jail. 

Inmates are permitted to have pens in the jail, Smith said, but not
in the visiting room. ``That's the weapon of choice,'' he said. It
was unclear whether the pen Kimes used belonged to him or the
reporter. 

Kimes and his mother, Sante Kimes, 65, were convicted of conspiring
to steal the town house of Irene Silverman, an <TIMEX2 val="P82Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-06" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="It doesn't say when she was murdered. All you can do is say her 82 years occured before the date of sentencing.">82-year-old</TIMEX2> woman
whom they had first met at an anti-aging conference, and of
murdering her in the process. 

Though Silverman's body was never found, prosecutors presented 14
notebooks full of detailed plotting, including Silverman's schedule
and a list of items to gather, including leg irons. 

Kimes and his mother maintained their innocence, even as they were
found guilty on 118 counts, including murder, burglary and robbery.
At the sentencing hearing, Kimes gave a long, venomous speech. Among
his complaints: Court TV had been allowed to videotape the
proceedings.
