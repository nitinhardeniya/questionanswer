The dot-coms may get the publicity. But John F. Welch Jr. is certain
that companies like General Electric will reap the profits. 

``The Internet was made for big companies,'' said Welch, GE's
chairman and Web champion-in-chief. ``The dot-coms understand buying
and selling. But the real efficiencies come in that middle part of
the equation: making things.'' 

Long before the Web, sophisticated old-economy companies were using
computer networks, and even the Internet, to communicate with
suppliers, to fine-tune inventories, to streamline back-office
functions. 

But the Web, as an easy to use interface for the Internet, has
opened large swaths of uncharted territory for industrial America.
Through Web-based buying consortiums, through auctions and reverse
auctions and various other types of e-marketplaces, companies are
saving millions of dollars in the procurement of supplies and
services. 

The Web is changing the sell side, too. With well-designed home
pages, companies can pitch their products at businesses too small to
warrant a sales call and at consumers who may live <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">hours away from
the nearest store or distributor</TIMEX2>. The companies can anticipate
questions and post answers before the queries are even made. They
can let customers download software that helps them update their
products. 

Diversified corporations, meanwhile, are learning to use the Web to
bundle services. In <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-10T17:14:10" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the near future</TIMEX2>, for example, someone buying a
refrigerator from GE Appliance's Web site might receive an offer
from GE Capital to finance the purchase. 

GE, with its corporate tentacles reaching into businesses as diverse
as X-ray machines, mortgages and light bulbs, provides perhaps the
leading example of what an old-economy company can do with
new-economy tools. GE Plastics put up the company's first Web page
on <TIMEX2 val="1994-10-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 21, 1994</TIMEX2>; <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-12-10T17:14:10" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, each GE business sells products on the Web.
And <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, GE will probably buy $6 billion of goods through the
Web. 

``We'll save hundreds of millions of dollars,'' Welch said.
``Nothing else would give you that type of quantum change.'' 

The Web is also letting GE help its own customers compare notes. GE
posts data on its Web pages _ stripped, of course, of identification
_ on how efficiently hospitals use its CAT scanners, how often
airlines do routine maintenance on its engines, how well utilities
use waste heat or water to generate more electricity. Customers with
a password can tap into the data and use it to benchmark their own
performance. 

GE is even using the Web to let customers test-drive software,
including the programs the company has developed to help hospitals
make more efficient use of some medical equipment. GE will let them
download the software and use it free _ for <TIMEX2 val="P30D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">30 days</TIMEX2>. After that, the
software self-destructs, unless the customer has paid to receive a
permanent version. 

``With the Web, <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2> you wake up and laugh at how little you
knew <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="implied set">the day before</TIMEX2>,'' Welch said. ``It's like peeling back an
onion. <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Every day</TIMEX2> we uncover hundreds of millions of dollars in
efficiencies.''
