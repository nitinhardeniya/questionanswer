WASHINGTON _ Advocates for more frequent disclosure of what mutual
funds hold in their portfolios sparred with a top Securities and
Exchange Commission official <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> at a panel sponsored by a fund
shareholder advocacy group. 

Donald Phillips, chief executive of Morningstar Inc., which tracks
mutual funds, said that Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the SEC, had
a double standard toward stockholders and mutual fund shareholders. 

``He's brilliant when he talks about stocks,'' said Phillips,
adding, ``when it turns to fund issues, he falls into patronizing
platitudes about fund investing.'' 

Levitt and the SEC are requiring companies to disclose material
information to the public at the same time that they tell analysts
and institutional investors. The new measure, Regulation FD, is set
to take effect <TIMEX2 val="2000-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later this month</TIMEX2>. But Phillips said that the SEC had
not applied similar rules to the $7 trillion mutual fund industry
and that the SEC should press the industry to disclose more
frequently which stocks funds hold. 

Under <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-12T17:15:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> regulations, mutual funds are required to disclose
their full holdings to the SEC twice <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year</TIMEX2>. Phillips thinks
portfolios should be disclosed <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">monthly</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="we have no way of capturing the semantics of this expression. Even if we start using ANCHOR attributes with point expressions, we would need more descriptive power for this one.">90 days after <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of
each month</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. 

Paul F. Roye, the director of the SEC's division of investment
management, said he ``had to do a bit of an Al Gore'' and defend his
boss' record. 

``The chairman is committed to protecting investors,'' he said,
adding that it was ``an overstatement'' to say that all investors
wanted more frequent disclosure of mutual fund portfolios. ``There's
a group of investors that want more information, and there's also a
group of investors who say they are inundated with information,''
Roye said. 

Roye suggested that large, closely watched funds like Fidelity's
$104 billion flagship Magellan fund might have difficulty trading in
and out of positions with too frequent disclosure and that funds
like Fidelity's $104 billion flagship Magellan fund might have
difficulty trading in and out of positions with too frequent
disclosure and that there were higher priorities like making fund
prospectuses easier to read and toughening regulation of schemes to
manipulate funds before they report their <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-QX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">quarterly</TIMEX2> performance
figures. 

Roye also said that his division would propose a rule requiring
mutual funds to have 80 percent of their portfolios invested in the
style, asset class or region indicated by the name of the fund, so
that a European investment fund, for example, would have to be 80
percent invested in Europe. The <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-12T17:15:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> requirement is 65 percent. 

The panel discussion, whose focus was on the disclosure issue, was
sponsored by Fund Democracy, a fund shareholder advocacy group
founded by Mercer Bullard, a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-12T17:15:00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> lawyer for the SEC's enforcement
division. 

Phillips and Harold R. Evensky, a financial planner, repeatedly
criticized the SEC's emphasis on simplification over portfolio
disclosure. 

``You need to make the information available,'' Evensky said. ``Can
you imagine a corporation just issuing a simple prospectus because
the financials are too complicated?''
