Suharto's Son Fails To Obey Summons

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The youngest son of ex-dictator Suharto
disobeyed a summons to surrender himself to prosecutors <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> and
be imprisoned for corruption. 

Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra, 37, was sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P18M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-02" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="context allows more specific anchor_val">18 months in
prison</TIMEX2> on <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sept. 22</TIMEX2> by the Supreme Court, which overturned an earlier
acquittal by a lower court. 

It found him guilty of enriching himself through a property deal
with the state's main food supply agency. Prosecutors said the <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1997</TIMEX2>
deal, made when his father was still in power, had cost the
Indonesian state $10.8 million. 

Tommy, a multimillionaire with a playboy image and love of fast
cars, is the first member of Suharto's family to be convicted of
graft. 

Because the Supreme Court's decision to imprison Tommy did not come
into immediate effect, prosecutors served a summons on Tommy to be
taken into custody <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>. He instead sent a legal team to discuss
whether he would appeal the ruling or admit his guilt and seek a
presidential pardon. 

The delay of Tommy's arrest comes <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">just days after another court
dismissed other corruption charges against his <TIMEX2 val="P79Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">79-year-old</TIMEX2> father on
grounds of ill health, enraging pro-democracy activists and
triggering violent demonstrations</TIMEX2>. 

Critics of Indonesia's legal system have accused it of going soft on
the Suharto clan. 

A co-defendant in Tommy's case, businessman Riccardo Gelael,
separately admitted his guilt <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> to prosecutors and said he
would appeal to President Abdurrahman Wahid for a pardon. 

Antasari Ashar, chief of South Jakarta Prosecution Office, said
Tommy would again be summoned to meet prosecutors on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>. 

If Tommy opts for a judicial review of the case, his fate will be
decided by the same court that <TIMEX2 val="2000-W39" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> dismissed graft charges
against his father. 

The decision to let Suharto off triggered fierce street
demonstrations, in which one man died and dozens were injured. 

For <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W39" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">weeks</TIMEX2> Suharto's trial had been marred by a series of bombings in
Jakarta, including a blast at the city's stock exchange building in
which 15 people were killed. 

Many suspect supporters of Suharto, who ruled for <TIMEX2 val="P32Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">32 years until his
ouster in <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, were behind the attacks.
