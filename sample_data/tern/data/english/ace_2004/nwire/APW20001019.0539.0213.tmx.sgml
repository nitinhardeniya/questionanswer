SEPANG, Malaysia (AP) _ Michael Schumacher is still celebrating
Ferrari's first Formula One title since <TIMEX2 val="1979" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1979</TIMEX2>. 

``It was a great relief crossing the line at Suzuka,'' Schumacher
said of the <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 8</TIMEX2> Japanese Grand Prix. ``There has been a couple of
tons of stone falling away. I'm unable to find the exact words to
express in a proper way what it was like.'' 

``The pressure could not have been higher <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T07:00:43" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> that we
have fulfilled our main wish, the pressure will be less.'' 

Schumacher, the German star who won titles in <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2> with
Benetton, enters <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>'s <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">season</TIMEX2>-ending Malaysian Grand Prix with an
insurmountable 12-point lead over two-time defending champion Mika
Hakkinen of McLaren. 

``<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T07:00:43" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> that we have achieved the first target, the next target we
would like is the constructors' championship,'' Schumacher said.
``It is in our hands. We just need a fourth place, which is well
within our means.'' 

Ferrari leads McLaren by 13 points. Hakkinen and McLaren teammate
David Coulthard need to finish at least first and third and shut out
Ferrari grab snatch the constructors' title. 

However, if Schumacher and teammate Rubens Barrichello score at
least three points, or if a McLaren does not win the race, Ferrari
will have the constructor and driving double for the first time
since <TIMEX2 val="1979" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1979</TIMEX2>, when Jody Scheckter paced Ferrari to both victories. 

``It has taken <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">five years at Ferrari</TIMEX2> to be competitive from the
first race until the last,'' Schumacher said. ``<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-19T07:00:43" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> that we have it,
it is nice to be there and we have to take advantage of the
situation.'' 

Schumacher has eight victories <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2> and 43 overall, second only
to Alain Prost (53) on the career list. 

``I'm still young. I'm only <TIMEX2 val="P31Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">31 years old</TIMEX2>. I enjoy racing. I enjoy
working with Ferrari,'' Schumacher said. ``I simply want to enjoy
more of this time like we had at Suzuka. And I am sure we will and
why not enjoy it together.'' 

Schumacher has a contract with the Italian team through <TIMEX2 val="2002" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2002</TIMEX2>. 

``It's too early to start speculating about what I will do after
<TIMEX2 val="2002" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2002</TIMEX2>,'' Schumacher said. ``I'll start thinking about it at <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end
of 2001</TIMEX2> or at <TIMEX2 val="2002" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the beginning of 2002</TIMEX2>. Not before.'' 

A practice session is set for <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, and the drivers will qualify
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> for <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>'s 56-lap race on 3.44-mile circuit. 

``I would like to win the race,'' Schumacher said. ``I see this as a
race for fun.''
