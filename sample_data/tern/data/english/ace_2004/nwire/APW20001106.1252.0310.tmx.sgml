British Airways To Sell Go Division 
</HEADLINE>

LONDON (AP) _ British Airways PLC plans to sell Go, its profitable
cut-price subsidiary launched <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two years ago</TIMEX2>, the company said
<TIMEX2 val="2000-11-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>. 

BA announced the sale as it reported 160 percent growth in its
<TIMEX2 val="2000-Q2" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">second-quarter</TIMEX2> pretax profit, an improvement that suggests Britain's
unofficial flag carrier may finally be entering sunnier financial
skies. 

``Thanks to everyone who works at Go, it is now a leading European
brand,'' said Rod Eddington, British Airways' <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06T13:40:39" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> appointed
chief executive. 

``It has made a profit <TIMEX2 val="2000-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every month this year</TIMEX2>. However, given the
strategic goals we have set for the group as a whole, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06T13:40:39" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06T13:40:39" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the
time for British Airways to gain the benefits of its investment and
realize the considerable value created in Go</TIMEX2>.'' 

Go is based at Stansted airport, northeast of London, a major base
for low-fare carriers operating in Britain. BA set up Go when
smaller rivals began nibbling away at its market share by offering
cheaper flights across much of Europe. 

One such competitor, easyJet, has long accused BA of unfairly
subsidizing Go. BA has denied the accusation but until <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-06T13:40:39" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> has not
said whether Go was making money. 

British Airways reported a pretax profit of 200 million pounds ($290
million) in <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q2" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the second quarter ending <TIMEX2 val="2000-09-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sept. 30</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, compared to 40
million pounds <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year ago</TIMEX2>. Its <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-QX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">quarterly</TIMEX2> operating profit improved
to 361 million pounds ($523 million) from 211 million pounds <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year
ago</TIMEX2>. 

This income growth indicated that BA's new strategy of trying to
attract more business and first-class passengers has started to pay
off. BA said its number of premium passengers increased by 7.7
percent during <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q2" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-09-30" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the quarter</TIMEX2>, while revenues for <TIMEX2 val="P6M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-01" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the first six months
of <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the year</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> rose 4.9 percent to 4.86 billion pounds ($7.05 billion). 

``We are taking a ruthless approach towards poorly performing routes
and assets,'' said Eddington. ``Those not adding value are being
removed. It is imperative that each of our aircraft generates
shareholder value.'' 

The airline said it plans to cut capacity worldwide by 10 percent in
<TIMEX2 val="2001-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next summer</TIMEX2>'s schedule. 

``We have a number of different businesses operating separately
within Europe. We are currently examining how we can better
rationalize and integrate their activities to deliver better value
for the group overall,'' Eddington said. 

Company shares jumped 7 percent to 352 pence ($5.10) each in <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-06" mod="MID" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">midday</TIMEX2>
trading on the London Stock Exchange. 

BA, the world's fourth-biggest airline in terms of passenger
traffic, has struggled to find its way in <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent years</TIMEX2>. 

It lost 50 million pounds ($75 million) in <TIMEX2 val="2000-Q1" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the first quarter</TIMEX2>, due to
high fuel costs and competition, and <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> was the airline's
worst since the British government privatized it. 

Competition has become intense, particularly on its core
trans-Atlantic flights, and former chief executive Bob Ayling
resigned in <TIMEX2 val="2000-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">March</TIMEX2> after <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-03" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">a troubled four-year stint</TIMEX2>. Talks on a
long-planned merger with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines collapsed in
<TIMEX2 val="2000-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September</TIMEX2>.
