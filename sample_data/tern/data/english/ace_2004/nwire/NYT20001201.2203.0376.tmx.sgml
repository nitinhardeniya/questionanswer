William Barry Furlong, a widely read sports columnist, magazine
writer and author, died <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last Saturday</TIMEX2> in Silver Spring, Md. He was
73. 

The cause was complications from leukemia, his family said. 

Furlong wrote for The Chicago Daily News and The New York Times
Magazine, and from <TIMEX2 val="1974" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1974</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="1979" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1979</TIMEX2> he was a sports columnist for The
Washington Post. He also contributed to Sports Illustrated, Newsweek
and The Saturday Evening Post. After leaving newspaper work, he was
a management consultant in Washington, often writing on economic
affairs. 

He wrote three books: ``Go for Broke,'' with the golfer Arnold
Palmer; ``Season With Solti,'' <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="i don't think this is part of the title, but it's oddly phrased">a year with the Chicago Symphony and
its conductor</TIMEX2>, Sir Georg Solti; and ``More Than Two Aspirin,'' about
the treatments for migraine headaches. 

As a high school senior, he started writing professionally, first
for The Southtown Economist in Chicago. He received a bachelor's
degree in aeronautical engineering from the Illinois Institute of
Technology. 

Furlong, who lived in Washington, is survived by his wife of <TIMEX2 val="P37Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">37
years</TIMEX2>, Isabel; a son, William B. Furlong Jr. of Seattle; and a
sister, Elizabeth J. Furlong of Chicago. 

He was known for intriguing first paragraphs of articles. 

--On the young Jack Nicklaus: ``Of all the rich, old malevolent
illusions assaulted by Jack Nicklaus in <TIMEX2 val="P20M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">his first 20 months as a
professional golfer</TIMEX2>, the one that old-timers on the circuit were
most disturbed to see shattered _ or at least cracked _ was the
notion that golf is an impossibly difficult game to master.'' 

--On Gordie Howe: ``Nowhere are the dark forces that impel a man
toward athletic self-destruction more clearly definable than in a
hockey player _ indeed, &UR; the &LR; hockey player _ named Gordon
Howe.'' 

--On Smoky Burgess, one of baseball's best pinch-hitters: ``Forrest
Harrill (Smoky) Burgess is a short, round, mildly ulcerous man whose
job in baseball is to demonstrate that they also serve who mostly
sit and wait.'' 

--On Al Lopez: ``The mystique of the positive-thinking Al Lopez, who
manages the Chicago White Sox, an occasional baseball team that has
astonished the sports world, is a rich enigma based largely, he
claims, on a policy of doing nothing and doing it well.''
