KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The ruling Taliban militia on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>
released 137 Shiite Muslim prisoners it had held for <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-20" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">nearly two
years</TIMEX2> and urged the opposition to follow suit and release government
prisoners it is holding. 

The freed men, all said to be fighters belonging to the opposition
alliance, were released ahead of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the Islamic holy month of Ramadan,
when devout Muslims fast from <TIMEX2 val="TMO" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">sunrise</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="TEV" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">sunset</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. 

``The prisoners are being released as a gesture of kindness'' by the
Taliban's supreme leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, said the Taliban's
Interior Minister Abdul Razzak Akhund. ``We ask the opposition to
show their heart and release government prisoners in their jails.'' 

The opposition alliance, which controls barely five percent of
Afghanistan and is fighting a war against the dominant Taliban, is
mostly made up of the country's minority ethnic and religious
groups. 

The Taliban are predominantly Sunni Muslim, which is the majority
Islamic sect in the country. 

The Taliban have been accused by international human rights groups
of mistreating the minority Shiite Muslims, a charge they reject. 

The newly released prisoners were captured when the Taliban took
control of Afghanistan's central Bamyan province, <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">nearly two years
ago</TIMEX2>. The area is largely inhabited by minority Shiite Muslims. 

``I am very happy to be going home,'' said Ali Jan, one of the
prisoners who said he was a farmer in Bamyan and not a soldier.
