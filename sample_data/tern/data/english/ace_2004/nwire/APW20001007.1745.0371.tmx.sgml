NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Joseph's Tomb, the flashpoint in <TIMEX2 val="2000-W40" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a week of
bitter West Bank clashes</TIMEX2>, is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-07T18:21:36" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> a casualty of war. 

The steps leading down to the tomb are strewn with stones chipped
off the walls. The top of the dome is smashed through in two places.
Inside the tomb, soggy books, burned sleeping bags and scattered
cans of food litter the muddy floor, and the walls are charred black
from fire. 

But the stone sarcophagus is untouched, perhaps the one object still
respected at this holy site, revered by some as the burial place of
the biblical patriarch. The compound was home to a Jewish seminary,
where about 30 students would study during <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2>. 

The Israeli army evacuated the outpost before <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-07TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">dawn</TIMEX2> on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday,
after clashes there <TIMEX2 val="2000-W40" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> killed six Palestinians and an Israeli
border policeman</TIMEX2>. The seminary had been closed during the violence. 

Palestinian security officials were left standing guard as hundreds
of Palestinians converged on the square in front of the site,
cheering the withdrawal. 

With the arrival of dozens of Palestinian gunmen, the celebration
degenerated into a trashing of the compound, with crowds vandalizing
the tomb, setting fires and hammering away at the stone buildings. 

``We did it so the Jews never come back,'' said Haitham Najid Kabee,
14, who vandalized the tomb with his friends. 

Nablus Gov. Mahmoud Aloul came to the square to plead with the
vandals to stop. 

``We should protect this building and make it a symbol for our
martyrs who were killed defending it,'' said Aloul, whose son was
killed in clashes <TIMEX2 val="2000-W40" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>. ``We will stop here together and
prevent any Jews from coming back to this place.'' 

But the governor's call went unheeded. Demonstrators threw Jewish
prayer books from the tomb, burning and tearing them. Some laughing
teens walked out of the compound wearing Israeli helmets and vests
found inside. 

Dozens climbed on the roof of the tomb and began hammering, breaking
off chunks of rock. By <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-07TAF" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late afternoon</TIMEX2>, firefighters had put out
three fires in the compound. 

People still wandered curiously around the small enclave, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-07T18:21:36" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> topped
by a large flag of the radical Islamic group Hamas, and a smaller
Palestinian flag. 

``I am very happy,'' said Nidal Abdel Jawad, 40. ``It was still
occupation as long as they were here.'' 

The withdrawal of troops from the tomb marked the first time Israel
has relinquished territory as a direct result of Palestinian
violence. 

Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said the enclave had become a
liability. But after the destruction that followed the withdrawal,
Israeli officials were furious. 

``The Palestinians betrayed their commitment and have let this
shrine fall into the hands of the mob waiting outside,'' said
Israeli government spokesman Nahman Shai. He said the government
``deeply deplores'' the trashing of the tomb. 

A statement by the 15-member European Union also condemned the
destruction. 

The tomb's holiness is disputed, as tradition holds that Joseph was
actually buried in Egypt; the connection of the site to Joseph is a
relatively recent local Arab tradition also observed by some Jews. 

``What I want to understand is if Joseph is not buried there, why
this place was so important,'' said Abdul Fateh Sayed, 62, whose
bookstore across the street was hit by stray bullets in the
fighting. 

``<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-07T18:21:36" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> it's over. We are very happy,'' he said, leafing through a
thick law book, its pages shot through by bullets. ``There should
never have been a military base in a civilian area.''
