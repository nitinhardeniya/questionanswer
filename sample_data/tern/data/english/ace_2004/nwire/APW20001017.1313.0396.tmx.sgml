Gore, Bush Prepare for Final Debate 
</HEADLINE>

ST. LOUIS (AP) _ As Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore
prepared to perch on stools and take voters' questions in a crucial
third debate, the sudden death of Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan cast a
pall over their final meeting. 

After talk of cancellation or a postponement for mourning, plans
were made <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early Tuesday</TIMEX2> to continue the <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17T21:00-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">9 p.m. EDT</TIMEX2> event on
schedule, officials of both campaigns said. 

``In the end, there was general agreement that Mel Carnahan would
have wanted us to go forward,'' a senior Bush campaign official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 

Bush's wife, Laura, canceled plans for a <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">morning</TIMEX2> rally. Bush
campaign officials also decided to tone down a post-debate rally,
and were even considering canceling it. Gore hadn't planned any
events before the debate. 

Carnahan, a Democrat who was running for the Senate, campaigned with
Gore whenever the vice president was in Missouri and would have
accompanied Gore aboard Air Force II to a Kansas City rally on
<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>. Gore called Mrs. Carnahan with his condolences after the
news broke <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday night</TIMEX2>, aides said. 

``We're all waking up, honestly, to the tragedy and the pain of it
and the shock of it,'' Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday morning</TIMEX2> on CNN. 

The Bush and Gore campaigns did not talk to each other directly
about the possibility of postponement, but went through the debate
commission's director, Janet Brown, in a series of <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="not sure of dawn is markable. Is it a temporal expression, or celestial?">pre-dawn</TIMEX2> phone
calls. 

Eventually, Brown recommended that the debate should go on, and
neither side objected, according to campaign officials. 

The commission was to announce the plans <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later Tuesday</TIMEX2>, with each
candidate given <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="anchored within 2000-10-17, but no way to represent VAL wthout committing to a granularity">time at the debate's start to say a few words about
Carnahan, who died <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday night</TIMEX2> in the crash of a small plane</TIMEX2>. 

With the larger bloc of uncommitted voters across the nation
apparently holding the key to the election, both candidates were
clearly mindful of the high stakes if the encounter goes forward as
planned. 

The informal question-and-answer format is one Gore is comfortable
with, and he promised on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> to ``just have an open meeting,'' as
he had done many times before. 

Bush, who has less formal debate experience than the vice president
but whose standing in public opinion polls rose after the first two
face-offs, vowed to ``just tell it like it is.'' 

The debate, <TIMEX2 val="2000-W42" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">just three weeks before the <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 7</TIMEX2> election</TIMEX2>, will be
held on the campus of Washington University. 

While the moderator will be the same as in the Boston and
Winston-Salem, N.C., debates _ Jim Lehrer of PBS _ questions this
time will come from the audience. 

The Gallup polling organization, assigned by the Commission on
Presidential Debates to recruit questioners, started with a random
sample of all registered voters in St. Louis and its suburbs, and
then screened out all but ``uncommitted voters,'' said Frank
Newport, Gallup's executive editor. 

The result was a group of area voters who say they could support
either Gore or Bush _ though they might be leaning one way or the
other. 

The theater-in-the-round stage will be informally set with two
stools and surrounded by 100 questioners and an additional 500
onlookers. 

<TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday night</TIMEX2>'s debate marks the beginning of the final stretch. 

And, with polls continuing to show the race to be neck-and-neck, any
stumble could have major impact on a contest in which both
candidates are fiercely wooing a dwindling band of undecided voters. 

Gore held a mock debate on <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, inviting 23 voters to the
Innsbrook resort outside St. Louis to help him practice. 

``I'm going to do what I've done a lot of times in Tennessee, and
that is, just have an open meeting,'' Gore said. 

In <TIMEX2 val="P16Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">16 years in Congress</TIMEX2>, Gore held some 1,000 town meetings with
Tennessee constituents, and they've become a regular feature of his
presidential campaign. 

After an uncharacteristically muted demeanor in <TIMEX2 val="2000-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2>'s debate,
Gore, was looking to do better this time. 

``I don't think you play it safe,'' said Gore's campaign chairman,
William Daley, previewing the <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-17TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday night</TIMEX2> encounter. ``I think you
try to be very natural and lay out in a forward way the compelling
reasons for the election to go your way.'' 

Bush had long resisted the town-hall-style session, but in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-W42" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent
weeks</TIMEX2> on the campaign trail has been doing them <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="APPROX" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="really means 'less than' daily, but LESS_THAN isn't supposed to apply to points. I should apply to sets of points though.">almost daily</TIMEX2>. 

``I've felt comfortable about it,'' the Republican said <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>.
