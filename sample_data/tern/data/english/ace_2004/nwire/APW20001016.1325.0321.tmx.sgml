Survey Finds College Costs Rising

NEW YORK (AP) _ The price of a college degree continues to rise
faster than inflation, with tuition and fees at public <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four-year</TIMEX2>
colleges up an average 4.4 percent <TIMEX2 val="2000-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this fall</TIMEX2>, even more at private
schools, a new survey has found. And loans provide a growing chunk
of the extra money students need to pay for those degrees. 

Average in-state tuition and fees at public, <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four-year</TIMEX2> schools is
$3,510 <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">per semester</TIMEX2> _ $148 more than <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>, according to figures
released <TIMEX2 val="2000-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> by the College Board. On-campus room and board <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T13:30:59" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>
averages $4,960, up 5.1 percent. 

At private <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four-year</TIMEX2> colleges, tuition and fees average $16,332, up
5.2 percent from <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>. Room and board on campus is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T13:30:59" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> $6,209,
a 4.2 percent increase. 

Only public <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two-year</TIMEX2> schools, chiefly community colleges, stayed
below the current inflation rate _ but barely. Tuition rose <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
year</TIMEX2> to $1,705, up 3.4 percent, the survey found. 

Private <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two-year</TIMEX2> schools boosted tuition and fees to $7,458, a 7
percent rise. 

This pattern follows an old, familiar trend, said Joni Finney, a
policy analyst at the National Center for Public Policy and Higher
Education in San Jose, Calif. ``Colleges and universities have a
very difficult time controlling their costs,'' she said. 

``These institutions were underfunded in <TIMEX2 val="199" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the early part of the
'90s</TIMEX2>,'' Finney said. ''... But they've more than made up for lost
ground.'' 

But Stanley Eikenberry, president of the American Council on
Education, an umbrella group for higher education, said in a
statement, ``Given the large, fixed costs of most campuses, in
personnel and facilities especially, these numbers show institutions
are working hard to hold the line on increases.'' 

The <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-10-16T13:30:59" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2> increases push past inflation. The Consumer Price Index
rose 2.7 percent in <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1999</TIMEX2>; <TIMEX2 val="P8M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-01" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the first eight months of this year</TIMEX2>,
consumer prices rose at an <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> rate of 3.5 percent. <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last year</TIMEX2>,
college tuition and fees rose less than 5 percent. 

Despite the increases, college remains affordable and a good
investment, said College Board President Gaston Caperton in a
statement with the surveys. ``In both earning potential and learning
potential, you cannot beat the value of a college education,'' the
former West Virginia governor said. 

The College Board's figures concern the costs for 6.4 million
full-time undergraduates _ 54 percent attending <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four-year</TIMEX2> public
institutions, 27 percent at <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four-year</TIMEX2> private schools, 17 percent at
<TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two-year</TIMEX2> community colleges and 1 percent at private <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two-year</TIMEX2>
schools. 

A majority of students need grants or loans _ or both _ but their
exact numbers are unknown, a College Board spokesman said. 

<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last school year</TIMEX2>, loans made up 59 percent of a record $68 billion
in financial aid. <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">A decade ago</TIMEX2>, loans made up just over 41 percent
of student financial help. 

The pool of money from federal, state and school sources <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>
was 4 percent greater than <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year earlier</TIMEX2>, but 88 percent more than
<TIMEX2 val="1989" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a decade before</TIMEX2>, taking inflation into account. 

The New York-based College Board is a nonprofit organization that
administers the SATs and promotes higher education. 

It surveyed more than 3,000 schools to find out undergraduate
charges for <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2001</TIMEX2>. The companion survey on financial aid, was
based on federal, state and school statistics from <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1999</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2>.
Current grant and loan figures are not available until <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the school
year</TIMEX2> ends.
