GROSSE POINTE PARK, Mich. _ <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-25T15:58:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">It</TIMEX2> is <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">deer hunting season</TIMEX2> in Michigan,
and hunters who climb trees with loaded shotguns have state
officials redoubling safety education efforts. 

Two men have been killed, and a third has been injured since <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
hunting season</TIMEX2> opened on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 15</TIMEX2>. All three accidents involved
shotguns, elevated platforms and a practice relatively new to
Michigan hunters _ shooting at deer from trees. <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">The Michigan season</TIMEX2>,
one of the busiest, continues through <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 30</TIMEX2>. 

Firearm hunting from elevated platforms has long been legal in other
states with heavy hunting, like New York and Pennsylvania. But the
practice is only in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">its third season</TIMEX2> in Michigan, and officials say
it appears that hunters still have a lot to learn about safety. Lt.
Suzanne Koppelo, hunter safety administrator of the law enforcement
division of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources &UR; , &LR;
said that since firearm platform hunting began in Michigan there had
been seven shooting accidents linked to the practice. Three were
fatal. Two hunters shot themselves on platforms and another was
killed on the ground by a hunter shooting from a platform. ``If
hunters exercised the kind of caution one would expect at heights of
20-some feet, it would be almost a nonissue,'' said Koppelo. ``But
given human nature, that's not the case.'' 

More than 750,000 licensed hunters are taking to the Michigan woods
<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the
state's 1.9 million deer. The numbers reinforce the need to improve
education about platform hunting with firearms, Koppelo said. 

The practice is more commonly associated with hunters using bows and
arrows. Instead of hiding on the ground or walking through the
woods, they wait quietly, typically at a height of 15 to 20 feet,
and fire down at deer that wander below. 

Despite the hunter killed from the platform, Sgt. Larry D. Sargent,
hunter education field coordinator for the law enforcement division,
says the practice does offer one safety advantage: errant shots
typically thump harmlessly to the ground, rather than whistling
through the woods and striking other people. 

The problems primarily arise when hunters get in and out of
position. 

``It's kind of hard climbing a tree with a gun,'' Rob Williams said,
as he and a hunting partner, Art Bush, waited on <TIMEX2 val="2000-XX-XXTMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="not sure how to tag this">a recent morning</TIMEX2> in
a conventional earthbound hunting blind about 20 miles west of
Detroit. 

For Williams, Rule No. 1 is not to climb a tree with a loaded gun.
He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a rope
dangling from his belt to his gun, which he leaves unloaded on the
ground. When he is secure in his stand, he pulls his gun up after
him and loads it. Sargent says this is proper procedure. 

One accident <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>, however, illustrates the importance of
following each step of the safety procedures. A <TIMEX2 val="P16Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">16-year-old</TIMEX2> hunter
used a haul line, but it was tied to the trigger guard and he left
the gun loaded, Koppelo said. The teen-ager's gun went off and he
was shot in the foot. 

Others are hurt falling out of trees. Koppelo said that state
officials were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it
was difficult, since they relied on hunters reporting minor
accidents. 

``A lot of guys are embarrassed,'' Sargent said. ``They'll say they
fell working in the yard or something.'' 

Others, Koppelo says, do not want to report accidents for fear the
law will be changed. And she adds that though anecdotal reports show
Michigan's large hunting population to be taking slowly to firearm
deer hunting from platforms, most expect the practice to catch on as
it has in other states. 

As Peter Thompson, a <TIMEX2 val="P16Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">16-year-old</TIMEX2> hunter, said, ``Usually the deer
don't look up.''
