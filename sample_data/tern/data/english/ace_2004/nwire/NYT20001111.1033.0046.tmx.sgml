A majority of women, older voters, Democrats, liberals and black,
Hispanic and Asian voters cast their ballots for Al Gore. George W.
Bush captured the votes of most men, whites, conservatives,
Republicans, Southerners and white Protestants. Ralph Nader, who
received 2 percent of the vote, did best among independents,
particularly liberal ones, and among young men. 

But the national election was so close because several large groups
_ voters under 65, independents, voters from the Midwest and the
West and suburbanites _ divided their votes almost evenly between
the two major candidates. 

The accompanying table, drawn from surveys of voters leaving the
polls (including those in Florida), shows how different groups have
voted for president since <TIMEX2 val="1976" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1976</TIMEX2>. 

Because large numbers of people are surveyed, exit polls can help
measure the preferences of groups like Jewish or Asian voters or
young blacks or liberal Republicans whose portion of the voting
population is often too small to examine in typical telephone
surveys. 

The Gender Gap 

Bush received a majority of votes from men and Gore was backed by a
majority of women. That's been a trend for <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">at least 20 years</TIMEX2>: more
women vote for Democrats; more men prefer Republicans. 

<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This year</TIMEX2>, the gap was especially large. Gore got more votes from
women than from men: 12 percentage points more. The gender gap cut
across all age groups and education levels, even among black voters,
who strongly supported Gore overall. 

The gender gap was widest among college graduates and unmarried
voters. 

Party Identification 

Few voters crossed party lines. Large majorities of Republicans
supported Bush. Gore won the votes of most Democrats. Voters who
identified themselves as independent split almost evenly. 

Most independents who described their political ideology as liberal
supported Gore. Bush was backed by independents who characterized
themselves as conservative. Moderate independents were very closely
divided. 

Where They Live 

As in <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>, most Easterners supported the Democrat. But while <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four
years ago</TIMEX2>, Southerners were evenly divided between Bill Clinton and
Bob Dole, <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2> Bush carried the the South. The Midwest and the
West were almost evenly divided between the two candidates. 

Gore did best among urbanites. Bush ran stronger in smaller towns
and in rural areas. Suburban voters split about evenly. 

Pocketbook Concerns 

Voters who say their finances have improved during a president's
tenure usually favor the incumbent, while the challenger is
preferred by those who say their financial situation has
deteriorated. That held true <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>. Gore was strongly backed by
voters who said their family's finances were better than <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four years
ago</TIMEX2>. Bush won the support of those who said their financial
situation had deteriorated. 

In <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>, one in three voters said their economic situation had
improved over <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the previous four years</TIMEX2>. <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This year</TIMEX2>, half did. 

Generally, those who say their economic conditions have not changed
divide their support between the two major candidates pretty evenly.
<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This year</TIMEX2>, though, two in three voted for Bush. 

Data for <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2000</TIMEX2> were collected by Voter News Service based on
questionnaires completed by 13,279 voters leaving 300 polling places
