Five House Races Still Unsettled

WASHINGTON (AP) _ Doubts remain in five races for the House of
Representatives, and while recounts are likely to extend the
indecision they have no chance of erasing the Republican majority
for the incoming 107th Congress. 

The Associated Press has called winners in all but two House races:
New Jersey's 12th district battle between incumbent Democratic Rep.
Rush Holt and GOP challenger Dick Zimmer, who <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-13T21:43:28" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">formerly</TIMEX2> held the
seat; and in Florida's 22nd District, where veteran GOP Rep. Clay
Shaw has claimed a 586-vote victory following a recount over
Democrat Elaine Bloom. 

But there remained some doubt about narrow decisions in Minnesota,
California and Michigan, where the apparent losers refusing to
concede and recounts have either begun or are likely. 

In Michigan's 8th District, Republican Mike Rogers was leading
Democrat Dianne Byrum by just 152 votes during a recanvass that must
be completed by <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 21</TIMEX2>. Rogers has claimed the seat and was taking
part in freshman orientation events at the Capitol on <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>. 

``In my mind, the campaign is over,'' Rogers said. ``I'm here trying
to prepare for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next couple of years</TIMEX2>.'' 

In Minnesota, Republican Mark Kennedy won a 150-vote decision over
four-term Democratic Rep. David Minge for the 2nd District seat.
Minge has said he will file a lawsuit to request a recount, but
under state law he must wait until the results are certified <TIMEX2 val="2000-11-21" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov.
21</TIMEX2>. 

Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., had a more comfortable margin of 1,616
votes in his 38th District victory over Democrat Gerrie Schipske,
but she has refused to concede and awaits the results of absentee
ballots and provisional ballots cast by people whose names didn't
immediately match lists at polling stations. 

About 2,500 of these same provisional ballots also apparently hold
the key to the New Jersey race between Holt and Zimmer, but further
court action could delay a final result for <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">some time</TIMEX2>. And in
Florida, the same Palm Beach County disputes involved in the
presidential recount could lead to legal action by Bloom. 

Not counting the Florida and New Jersey races, Republicans <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-11-13T21:43:28" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> hold
220 seats in the incoming House and the Democrats have 211. There
are two independents, one aligned with each party, effectively
giving the GOP an edge of 221-212.
