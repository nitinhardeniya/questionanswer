China's Railway Ministry will use the railway project World Bank loan

equipment, with a total contract value of close to 20 million US
dollars.


Railway Ministry personnel presented that, this network construction
is a part of the national railway backbone telecommunication reform
project.

and goods owners from all over China, including the Hong Kong and
Macao regions, to check the situation of railway operations via
websites, to reserve passenger tickets or goods allocation in
advance, and to track departure and arrival locations of goods.

finally determining that the program controlled switch products of

This was also one of the most important orders won by China's
domestically manufactured program controlled switching products.
