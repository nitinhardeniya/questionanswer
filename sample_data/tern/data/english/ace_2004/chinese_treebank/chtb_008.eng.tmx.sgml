<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">A few years ago</TIMEX2>, Beihai was still an unknown small fishing village on
the Northern Gulf, yet within <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">three</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">five years</TIMEX2>, Beihai has
constructed the framework of a modernized city: on the streets people
flow like the tide and buildings spring from the ground.

Beihai has already become a bright star arising from China's policy
of opening up to the outside world.


Beihai city's rise to prominence is one of the important indicators
of the remarkable achievements attained by the Guangxi Zhuangzu
Autonomous Region in its <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent years of opening up to the outside
world</TIMEX2>.

<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-02-14" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>, Guangxi has initially formed an overall pattern of opening up to
the outside world at various fields and levels, which is
characterized by mutually linking together opening coastal cities,
opening coastal economic zones, and opening border cities and towns,
and advancing from the seacoasts, the borders, and the river borders
towards the hinterland.


Statistics show that, in <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past five years</TIMEX2>, Guangxi's foreign trade
and its use of foreign investments has expanded rapidly and that
imports and exports trade totaled 10 billion US dollars, of which
exports were 6.87 billion US dollars, increasing by 1.78 times and
1.43 times respectively as compared to those of <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1986" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the "seventh
<TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1986" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">five-year</TIMEX2> plan" period</TIMEX2> (<TIMEX2 val="1986" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1986</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2>). The actual use of foreign
investments added up to 3.324 billion US dollars, accounting for 84.4
percent of the total sum of 3.839 billion US dollars accumulated
since the reform and opening up started. Border trade volume was 12.4
billion yuan.


In <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent years</TIMEX2>, the government of the Guangxi Zhuangzu Autonomous
Region has made large adjustments to the entire region's economic
development strategy, development objective and development
arrangement, further accelerating the reform and the opening up; it
has also drafted three documents for attracting foreign capital,
strengthening horizontal economic integration and allowing more
authority for foreign operations.


In the arrangement of opening up and development, Guangxi places its
emphasis of opening on Beihai, Qinzhou, and Fangcheng making full use
of the role of its capital, Nanning, as an open city, promoting
coastal areas, border areas and riverside areas to open up further;
trying to properly manage the Municipal Integrated Reform
Experimental Zone in Liuzhou city, the Town and Country Integrated
Reform Experimental Zone in the Yulin area, the Tourism Development
Experimental Zone in Guilin, constructing both the Economic
Development Zone along the Youjiang River Valley Welfare Economic
Open Belt and the main project of the Welfare Integrated Open Belt,
the Hongshui River hydroelectric plant.

It has invested more than 130 billion yuan to strengthen the
construction of infrastructures and basic industries so as to create
a sound environment for expanding the opening up to the outside
world.


To further expand the opening up to the outside and promote outwardly
economic development, Guangxi has come up with a series of policies
to make use of foreign investments.

In <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent years</TIMEX2>, foreign businessmen have been quite actively
investing in Guangxi, manufacturing projects and large backbone
projects have increased, and such large companies with abundance
resources as Japan's Itochu Corporation, Korea's Daewoo Corporation,
Hong Kong's Changjiang Industry Group, etc. have all invested in
Guangxi one after another.

By <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of last year</TIMEX2>, the number of "three-capital" enterprises in
Guangxi passed 6000.


The convenience of coastal channels in the vast Southwest, Guangxi
has also strengthened the horizontal economic association with
provinces, regions and cities such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou,
Hunan, Tibet, Shanghai, etc.

According to incomplete statistics, Guangxi has cooperated with three
provinces and one region in southwest China (Sichuan, Guizhou and
Yunnan provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region) alone to implement
more than 1000 cooperative projects, with agreement capital of
several billion yuan.
