Jiangxi Province, located in the center of China, is becoming a

million US dollars.

of the introduction of foreign investment, with expediting
infrastructure construction, expanding productivity distribution,
adjusting product structures and transforming traditional industries.

industrial projects in Jiangxi provide a broad investment market for
foreign companies.

The program-controlled telephone and transmission systems of the

a role.
