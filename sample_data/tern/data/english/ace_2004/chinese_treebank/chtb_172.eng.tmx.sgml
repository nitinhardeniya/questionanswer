The Soviet Union prepares to withdraw Soviet troops stationed in
Poland starting in <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Not sure if year is '94 or '93?">May of <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Not sure if it is '94 or '93">this year</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> and withdraw completely before
<TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="MID" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the middle of 1994</TIMEX2>.


This is the suggestion put forward by Soviet side in Polish-Soviet
negotiations being held in Warsaw concerning issues of the Soviet
Union withdrawing troops from Poland and Russia's troops going across
the border.
