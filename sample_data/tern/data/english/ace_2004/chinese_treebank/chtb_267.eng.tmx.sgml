China and the US will co-operate in building China's first
large-capacity natural gas power plant

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, <TIMEX2 val="1994-09-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September 1st</TIMEX2>, by reporter Jingcai Wu

The Weir Group of the US <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-09-01T22:20:23" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> signed an implementation agreement
in Beijing with Jiangsu Province's Electric Power Department to build
China's first large-capacity power plant with liquefied natural gas
as fuel.


Aixing Dan, director of the International Co-operation Department of
the Electric Power Industry Ministry, on this matter, expressed to
Xinhua News Agency reporters <TIMEX2 val="1994-09-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> that if this power plant is
successful, it will be a model for similar plants to be built along
coastal regions.


Coal, water, oil, etc., are normally used for traditional electricity
generation.

However, using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory
electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation
efficiency and lower total cost, is beneficial to the environment,
etc.

According to presentations, with this type of electricity generation
method, a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can
produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600
degrees centigrade. This gas in turn can heat a boiler for the
production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates
electricity.

Because of the efficiency of this construction method, the
electricity generated is relatively competitive in price.

At <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the same time</TIMEX2>, using natural gas as fuel will also reduce
environmental pollution along coastal regions.


The Weir Group, whose headquarters is in the US, is a large,
specialized corporation investing in the area of electricity
generation.

The installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and
developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts.

Through the contact of the Yizhong Company of the US, the Weir Group
and the Jiangsu Electric Power Department reached an initial
agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity
generation plant.

This power plant, which will be situated in Rudong, Jiangsu, has an
<TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts. The investment
amount is 2.4 billion US dollars. The Chinese side holds 30% of the
shares while the Weir Group holds 70%.

According to the agreement, the Weir Group will be responsible for
the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by
the power plant.


Renzu Luo, managing director of the Weir Group, is optimistic over
the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity
generation along China's coastal regions.

He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market
development, liquefied natural gas has become the main material of
clean fuel used for electricity generation. When the gross national
product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan, etc., environmental protection awareness generally rose, and
all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by
liquefied natural gas.

As the gross national product in China's coastal regions begins to
approach this benchmark, it can be said to have had the conditions
for electricity generation using natural gas in terms of financial
resources.


John Weir, president of the Weir Group who visited China with US
Minister Brown and signed this agreement for electricity generation
plant construction in Jiangsu, held that <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-09-01T22:20:23" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-09-01T22:20:23" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the best time to
develop a project of joint circulatory electricity generation plant
with natural gas as fuel in China</TIMEX2>. Both parties, the US and China,
will invest <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">more time</TIMEX2>, money and resources to make this power plant
project a successful model.
