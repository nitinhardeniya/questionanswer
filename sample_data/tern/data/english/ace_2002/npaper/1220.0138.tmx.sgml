Hasim Rahman and Angel Manfredy claimed to be victims of crimes in the ring in 
Miami on <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-19TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday night</TIMEX2>. Both believe they were robbed. But they would have a 
better chance of getting assault charges filed against their opponents than 
theft charges against the referees. 

Rahman, pinned between the second and third ropes, was being pummeled by David 
Tua when the Referee Telis Assemenios stepped in to stop the heavyweight bout at 
<TIMEX2 val="PT35S" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored point">35 seconds of the 10th round</TIMEX2>. Manfredy, also pinned against the ropes, was being 
battered by Floyd Mayweather Jr. when the Referee Frank Santore stopped their 
bout at <TIMEX2 val="PT2M47S" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored point">2 minutes 47 seconds of the second round</TIMEX2>. 

Rahman (29-1) feels more victimized than Manfredy (24-3-1) does because Rahman 
was leading on all three judges' scorecards when the bout was stopped. And he 
had the presence of mind to react angrily when Assemenios called a halt to the 
fight, although Rahman staggered as he walked back to his corner. Manfredy 
seemed dazed as he headed back to his corner. Later he said politics and the 
desire to see Mayweather retain his World Boxing Council super featherweight 
title played heavily in the decision to stop the bout. 

It was not a strong argument, considering Mayweather (19-0) landed 56 of 120 
punches he threw in the two rounds and landed 45 of 86 power punches, according 
to CompuBox statistics, while Manfredy landed just 19 of 86 punches thrown and 
connected with just three jabs. 

Florida Boxing Commission rules do not allow for standing 8-counts. According to 
Assemenios, during prefight instructions in the dressing rooms boxers were 
informed that if they were in trouble they should take a knee and would be given 
an 8-count. 

Both Rahman and Manfredy were between the ropes, which could have been 
considered a knockdown and would have made them eligible for an 8-count. But 
Assemenios and Santore believed both fighters were unable to defend themselves. 

Steve Nelson, Rahman's co-manager, said he planned to file a protest with the 
International Boxing Federation, which sanctioned the bout, on the grounds that 
the stoppage was premature and because Tua (33-1) had hit Rahman after the bell 
in the previous round. Had Rahman's corner vehemently protested the late blow, 
it could have got a <TIMEX2 val="PT5M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">five-minute</TIMEX2> rest for its fighter. 

If the protest succeeds, the I.B.F. can order a rematch. If it fails, Tua will 
become the No.1 contender for the I.B.F. title, awaiting the outcome of the 
Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis unification bout on <TIMEX2 val="1999-03-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">March 13</TIMEX2> at Madison Square 
Garden.   TIMOTHY W. SMITH
