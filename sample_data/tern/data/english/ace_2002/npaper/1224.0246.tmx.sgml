SPORT utilities or sports cars? I'll take the latter, though <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-27" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s four-wheel 
rockets are so good that roads in the Northeast -- with low speed limits, radar 
traps and darting deer -- cannot really test their capabilities. But even when 
driven mildly, new Porsches and BMW's stood out, as did more practical, less 
pricey machines. 
  
AM GENERAL HUMMER -- ($66,522-$99,645) There are perfectly good reasons to drive 
this mammoth, sluggish, uncomfortable, deafening, costly -- and virtually 
unstoppable -- vehicle. Like, if you're in the Army. Or you have a ranch half 
the size of Saskatchewan. Or you're a celebrity and want everyone to know it. 
For most of the rest of us, it makes no sense at all. GRADE: D 


AUDI A4 1.8T -- ($24,290-$32,640) Why is the A4 such a joy? Is it the clean, 
sculptured lines? The steering, so close to perfection? The Quattro all-wheel 
drive? Or is it, with the arrival of a free-revving turbo four-cylinder, the 
satisfaction of fine German engineering at a price that starts in Subaru 
territory?A 
  
BMW M COUPE -- ($42,370) Forget ''Titanic'' and the Monica tapes. <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">The year</TIMEX2>'s best 
entertainment was this lean, mean Go Kart on 17-inch wheels. If you'd like to 
commute in a roller coaster, here's your ticket. A+ 
  
BMW M ROADSTER -- ($43,270) With a thumping engine from BMW's ''M'' works, this 
speedy variant of the Z3 softtop finally lives up to the styling's promise. Just 
don't push it too hard; the tail may wag the dog. A- 
  
BMW 3-SERIES -- ($26,970-$45,300) The quintessential sport sedans have been 
cautiously remade, with a bit more room, a little more luxury and an even more 
solid body structure. The 323i and 328i remain thoroughly wonderful drivers' 
cars.A 
  
CADILLAC ESCALADE -- ($46,525) Of folks who pretended to have more than they 
really did have, my grandmother would say they were ''putting on airs.'' Well, 
Grandma, here's a Chevy truck in a mink stole. C+ 
  
CHEVROLET CORVETTE -- ($38,777-$48,978) Muscular and impressive, America's 
sports car is a wild beast on a leash: awesome, but hard to take for a walk. 
Long trips may wear on you, but compared with its predecessors, this 'Vette is 
easy to live with. A cheaper hardtop puts it within grasp of the Camaro crowd. 
A- 
  
CHEVROLET SILVERADO -- ($15,995-$32,343) General Motors' most crucial vehicle is 
new from bow tie to tailgate, with excellent driving dynamics and a roomy, 
classy cabin. Alas, it doesn't look much different and it doesn't yet offer four 
doors. A 
  
CHRYSLER LHS -- ($29,445-$31,055) Chrysler's luxury leader is a glorified 
Chrysler Concorde. Nothing wrong with that, but the LHS is neither as refined 
nor as sophisticated as some cars it aspires to compete with. Still, the design 
is a knockout. B 
  
DAEWOO LEGANZA -- ($14,790-$19,360) This Korean flagship has interesting styling 
and decent workmanship. But it lists on turns and bounces on bumps, and the 
engine stumbles for no obvious reason. You can't take on Toyota with a car like 
this. D+ 
  
FORD RANGER -- ($12,850-$32,690) A freshening for <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">'98</TIMEX2> enhanced the appeal of 
Ford's little hauler -- still the class act among small pickups. B+ 
  
INFINITI G20 -- ($21,520-$25,320) Infiniti would have you think this is a 
Japanese BMW, a bargain sport sedan that runs with the big dogs. Alas, it's just 
a puppy. The steering is too slow, the chassis is too soft, the shifter is too 
imprecise, the engine is too meek. Not a Bimmer, but a nice Nissan Sentra. C+ 
  
LEXUS GS 400 -- ($45,505-$53,755) BMW's 5-Series has been the gold standard of 
sedans, a four-star balance of performance, style and comfort. Lexus took aim at 
the 5-Series and hit the bull's-eye: The GS is fast, poised, comfortable, 
exhilarating. It is virtually the equal of the 540i; it may be even better.A+ 
  
MERCEDES-BENZ CLK320 -- ($41,195-$51,795) Proof that Mercedes is becoming 
American, these coupes and convertibles are capable, opulent and 
ever-so-slightly daring -- a Teutonic update of the <TIMEX2 val="196" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">60's</TIMEX2> Buick Wildcat. B+ 
  
NISSAN FRONTIER -- ($12,010-$22,420) As trucks become ever more like cars, 
Nissan's small pickup seems stuck in <TIMEX2 val="197" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 70's</TIMEX2>. It handles nicely and the 
workmanship impresses, but it is cramped, uncomfortable, hard-edged and very old 
feeling. D+ 
  
OLDSMOBILE INTRIGUE -- ($21,735-$27,965) This midsize sedan impresses me more 
each time I drive it. Solid, and stylish in a quiet way, it is the kind of 
bread-and-butter car G.M. has needed for <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="199" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">decades</TIMEX2>, but had seemed incapable of 
pulling off. A 
  
PONTIAC GRAND AM -- ($16,595-$22,200) The <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">'99</TIMEX2> remake of this perennial hot 
seller wins, hands-down, the award for Most Improved. A rigid new body smooths 
the ride, but sporty gimmicks promise better handling than the suspension can 
deliver. B- 
  
PORSCHE 911 -- ($65,795-$84,540) The 911's first redesign in <TIMEX2 val="P34Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">34 years</TIMEX2> is 
stunning, from the coupe's clean, simple lines to high-speed handling best 
appreciated on a closed track. The downside is the window sticker, especially 
the Cabriolet's, which makes one appreciate the $42,000 Boxster all the more. A+ 

  
VOLVO C70 -- ($37,570-$48,165) The turbo is a screamer. The styling is -- for 
Volvo -- a show-stopper. The appointments are plush. Yet these limited-run 
coupes and convertibles feel unrefined and overpriced. C- 
  
VOLKSWAGEN NEW BEETLE -- ($16,425-$21,250) Sure, it's adorable. And yes, you 
(your 
mother/your swami/your financial planner) drove one of the originals (to 
Woodstock/to Haight-Ashbury/to Kabul, Afghanistan). But beyond all that, this is 
a fine car: stylish, comfortable, reasonably priced. It scores well in crash 
tests. The design is clever, the execution is brilliant and the materials set 
new standards for small cars. A+
