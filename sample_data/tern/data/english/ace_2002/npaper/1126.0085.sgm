Metallica never hid its influences. Band members invariably praised the new wave 
of British heavy metal, a late 1970's movement of bands inspired by punk's 
do-it-yourself practices, along with American punk rock and British metal bands 
like Budgie. It played their songs onstage, and as early as 1984 started to 
record them for B-sides and EP's. Metallica released one group of metal and punk 
cover versions for its ''Garage Days Re-Revisited'' EP (Elektra) and has just 
released ''Garage, Inc.'' (Elektra), a more varied two-CD set. 

On Tuesday night, Metallica played a full set of other bands' songs at Roseland. 


It was 90 minutes of unstoppable drive, simultaneously ferocious and meticulous. 
(For conceptual symmetry, the opening act, Battery, played Metallica songs.) 

Of course, Metallica was offering homage to its favorites. But it couldn't help 
adding one-upmanship. As it blasted through the old songs, Metallica showed 
where it learned the power of grinding or pummeling guitar riffs, the joys of 
heft and speed and the willingness to sing about mayhem and death. Yet for all 
Metallica picked up from Diamond Head (''Am I Evil?''), the Misfits (''Die Die My 
Darling''), Motorhead (''Overkill'') and Mercyful Fate (''Satan's Fall''), it was 
just as smart about what it eliminated. 

For its own songs, Metallica got rid of quasi-operatic high tenor vocals, 
trading them for James Hetfield's growl. And Mr. Hetfield didn't embarrass 
himself by singing about 70's metal commonplaces like Satan, mythology, rock 
stardom, self-pity or (until recently) love. Metallica lyrics stuck to power, 
oppression and death, while the music defiantly flexed its muscle. 

As Metallica drew on the unison riffing of Black Sabbath, the slow-fast 
contrasts of bands like Diamond Head and the adrenaline surge of punk, it 
subjected them to the musical equivalent of an acid bath, stripping away 
everything that didn't add propulsion or tumult. 

Mr. Hetfield on guitar and Jason Newsted on bass share tensile, unanimous riffs 
that are anchored to Lars Ulrich's drumming, which moves like an armored 
Ferrari, while way up above them, Kirk Hammett plays lead guitar lines that 
wriggle and zoom. Metallica's effect on 80's metal songs was similar to what 
happened to 80's movie heroes: they put on muscle, grew tight-lipped and started 
blowing things up. 

At Roseland, Metallica delivered the lyrics straight-faced as it retrofitted the 
music. While the recorded versions sometimes turn sterile with their flawless 
technique, onstage Metallica was visceral as well as virtuosic; Mr. Ulrich's 
drumming slammed home the beat with gut-punching impact. 

The band lent ominous grandeur to Bob Seger's maudlin ''Turn the Page,'' the only 
ballad in the set. 

It pumped up the virtuosity of punk songs like Sweet Savage's ''Killing Time,'' 
and its medley of Mercyful Fate songs showed why Mr. Hetfield praised them as 
''the riffmasters.'' Mr. Hammett made every solo flail and claw, streaking through 
triplets and cartwheeling across arpeggios. 

Metallica's own recent songs have slowed down, forfeiting the thrills of its old 
speed-metal. 

Hearing the band charge through the old songs gave hope that Metallica might 
rouse itself again. The band's current behemoth tread is impressive, but a 
behemoth that can sprint, as Metallica used to do, is a marvel.
