HEADLINE:  In Jerusalem, Clinton Visits A Fellow Embattled Leader

JERUSALEM, <STORY_REF_TIME>Dec. 13</STORY_REF_TIME> -  
Forced to confront the issue of impeachment today, President Clinton reluctantly 
interrupted his efforts to rescue the Middle East peace plan he cherishes to 
address a vote in Congress that he said he could not control. 

In answer to reporters' questions here, the President called his deposition in 
the Paula C. Jones sexual misconduct case ''difficult and ambiguous and 
unhelpful,'' but beyond that expressed none of the remorse that filled his 
remarks at the White House on Friday about his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. 

At his side, Israel's equally grim and even more embattled leader, Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, unavailingly implored reporters to ask about Mr. 
Clinton's ''very clear voyage of peace.'' 

''I would like to know the answers too,'' he added, not entirely kindly. 

It was in supporting Mr. Clinton's plans for peace that Mr. Netanyahu sacrificed 
his right-wing support and jeopardized his own hold on power. 

Today, in an extraordinary political tableau, the two men seemed far apart and 
the peace initiative in doubt as each tried to grapple with a complex interplay 
of domestic and foreign concerns -- and of self-interest, high purpose and 
power. 

In a round of meetings, speeches and ceremonial stops, Mr. Clinton focused on 
the peace effort, believing as ever, aides said, that success at his policy 
goals would win him support at home. But a pugnacious reception from Mr. 
Netanyahu made those goals seem distant. 

While he said that the coming Congressional vote on impeachment was ''out of my 
hands,'' Mr. Clinton was clearly not indifferent to it. This morning after 
midnight, once he reached his hotel, he made calls to two Democratic members of 
the House Judiciary Committee to assess the situation, advisers said. 

Later today he made his most forthright appeal that the House of Representatives 
consider censure as an alternative, saying that ''somewhere around three-quarters 
of the American people think that's the right thing to do.'' 

But speaking in combative terms, he dismissed calls by Republican moderates -- 
the same people who might support censure -- for an admission that he had lied 
under oath. 

''I could not admit to doing something that I am quite sure I did not do,'' he 
said. Two of the four articles of impeachment accuse him of committing perjury, 
but Mr. Clinton said that ''no credible argument'' demonstrated that he had done 
so. And he insisted that he had no intention of resigning. 

His aides in Washington are scrambling to line up votes against impeachment, but 
Mr. Clinton said today that he would make no calls to Republican members. He 
will talk to them if they seek him out, he said. 

''I don't know what's going to happen,'' he said. ''That's up to them.'' 

On his fourth trip to Israel as President, Mr. Clinton brought some wavering 
Congressmen with him, including two Republican members of the House. He met with 
the group this morning, but they discussed only the Middle East, said the White 
House press secretary, Joe Lockhart. 

Mr. Lockhart said the President was not preoccupied with the coming impeachment 
vote: ''I can tell you, thankfully, his ability to concentrate on the peace 
process is not predicated on reporters' questions to him. That's a very small 
part of the day.'' 

Traveling with his wife and daughter, Mr. Clinton began his day with breakfast 
with Mr. Netanyahu and ended it at an official dinner beside him. In between, 
the leaders alternated visions of the Palestinians' commitment to peace. On 
Monday, Mr. Clinton will visit Palestinian-controlled territory in the Gaza 
Strip. 

Mr. Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of complying with none of the commitments 
they made after marathon negotiations led by Mr. Clinton at Wye River Plantation 
in Maryland in October. The Prime Minister has refused to cede more land to the 
Palestinians until they comply. 

The President saw more progress. ''The Palestinian Authority has taken some 
important steps,'' he said. But, he said, ''They certainly could be doing better 
to pre-empt violent demonstrations in the streets.'' 

Apparently believing that symbols are substance here, Mr. Clinton paid careful 
attention to ceremony. Surrounded by children, he joined President Ezer Weizman 
in lighting the first candle of Hanukkah. 

And wearing a navy blue yarmulke on his silver hair, he silently placed an oval 
stone, which White House aides said had been taken from Wye River, on the 
tombstone of Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister assassinated by a far-right 
Israeli radical on Nov. 4, 1995. 

Less than six weeks before that, on Sept. 28, 1995, Mr. Rabin shook hands at the 
White House with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, over a deal broadening 
Palestinian self-government that Mr. Clinton considers a landmark achievement. 

Mr. Netanyahu repeatedly reminded Mr. Clinton of Israeli fears and 
determination. At the dinner tonight, Mr. Netanyahu lectured him on the Jews' 
lonely and turbulent history, as the Israeli leaders whose support he needs sat 
before him. He reminded Mr. Clinton of ancient Jewish ties to Gaza and 
Bethlehem, Palestine-controlled areas that the President will visit in the next 
two days. 

Despite Palestinian aspirations for some control of Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu 
fiercely called it ''a city which never was and never will be the capital of any 
other nation.'' 

''We have made excruciating sacrifices for peace,'' he said. ''We have given away 
parts of this land, parts which are the cradle of our civilization.'' He said he 
remained committed to the peace agreement. 

Mr. Clinton repeatedly affirmed the American commitment to Israeli security. But 
he also promoted the Wye agreement, which calls for Israel to withdraw in phases 
from another 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian steps 
against terrorism. 

In a speech this evening, he said the peace effort ''will succeed when we 
understand that it is not just about mutual obligations, but mutual interest, 
mutual recognition, mutual respect.'' 

As they negotiate, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Netanyahu have inverse problems and as a 
result, for the moment, opposed interests. Mr. Netanyahu's conduct of foreign 
policy -- specifically, his initial decision to abide by the Wye agreement -- 
has threatened his domestic position. Mr. Clinton's domestic troubles have 
raised questions in some Congressional minds about his ability to conduct 
foreign affairs, doubts he is trying to dispel here. 

But Mr. Clinton and Mr. Netanyahu also need each other. The President is very 
popular here, and Mr. Clinton has been warned that if Mr. Netanyahu's Government 
falls, the peace effort will freeze for six months. 

In his toast tonight, Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Netanyahu as ''the kind of leader 
with the potential to guide his people to a peaceful and secure future.'' 

And in his statement to reporters this afternoon, Mr. Netanyahu said: ''If 
there's anyone who can help bring the peace process to a satisfactory 
conclusion, it is you, President Clinton. Your devotion to this cause, your 
perseverance, your tireless energy, your commitment have been an inspiration to 
us all.''
