For the first time since <TIMEX2 val="1951" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1951</TIMEX2> there will be no National Basketball Association 
All-Star Game. It's <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="point within a duration">Day 162 of the lockout</TIMEX2>. No new bargaining talks are 
scheduled. Do you think <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="sports season">the season</TIMEX2> is in peril? 

Canceling the All-Star Game, the league's signature <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="sport's season">regular-season</TIMEX2> event, had 
been expected for <TIMEX2 val="P1W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-W50" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">a week</TIMEX2>, but Commissioner David Stern's announcement <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2> 
revealed the dire straits <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2> is in. ''This is just a result of the 
inexorable march of the calendar,'' Stern said. ''There just isn't <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">enough time 
left to have <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a season</TIMEX2> and an All-Star Game</TIMEX2>.'' 

The game had been scheduled <TIMEX2 val="1999-02-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Feb. 14</TIMEX2> in Philadelphia. 

Stern spoke to Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-08TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday morning</TIMEX2>, and 
promised that Philadelphia would be awarded the game in <TIMEX2 val="2002" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2002</TIMEX2>. The Golden State 
Warriors will host <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="sports season">next season</TIMEX2>'s game, and the <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2001</TIMEX2> game is likely to go to 
Washington. 

Philadelphia officials estimated that the city and its business will lose out on 
about $40 million. Eighteen hotels, which had set aside more than 5,000 rooms 
for the league, had expected to make more than $6 million. <TIMEX2 val="1998-W48" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Two weeks ago</TIMEX2>, Jam 
Session, a <TIMEX2 val="P4D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four-day</TIMEX2> event of displays and interactive events, was canceled, and 
it had been expected to draw as many as 100,000 people to the Philadelphia 
Convention Center. 

Beyond the financial impact, Philadelphia was primed for its return to 
professional basketball prominence for perhaps the first time since Julius 
Erving and Moses Malone led the 76ers to the championship in <TIMEX2 val="1983" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1983</TIMEX2>. 

''We look at this as a deal for us to promote the league, but it's not a money 
maker of us,'' said a league official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 

Stern said, ''If we and our players, who are ultimately going to have to work 
together to rebuild this sport, can't make this deal, I don't think there is 
that much hope for the sport itself.'' 

The cancellation will mean a substantial loss in advertising revenue for NBC and 
Turner Sports. <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last year</TIMEX2> the game drew a 10.6 rating, meaning more than 10 
million households were tuned into the game at Madison Square Garden. Only the 
<TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Christmas Day</TIMEX2> game draws a similar <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">regular-season</TIMEX2> rating. 

Turner Sports drew a 2.7 rating for its All-Star <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> show <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">last season</TIMEX2>, a 
rating 1 point higher than its <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">regular season</TIMEX2> average of 1.7. 

''Like all other N.B.A. fans, we are disappointed by the cancellation of the 
All-Star Game,'' said Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports. ''But we continue to 
be hopeful that an agreement can be reached and <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2> will resume <TIMEX2 val="1999-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next 
month</TIMEX2>.'' 

The league's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, said: ''Clearly, the largest 
financial toll will be on the networks. It's the biggest <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">regular season</TIMEX2> event 
for NBC and Turner.'' 

Both networks have clauses in their contracts with the N.B.A. to recoup the 
losses through added games or reduced rights fees in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">subsequent seasons</TIMEX2>. 

Billy Hunter, the union executive director, said in a prepared statement: 
''Sadly, the owners have elected to cheat millions of fans and the city of 
Philadelphia out of a wonderful spectacle. Unfortunately for the owners, their 
effort to further intimidate the players will not succeed. We have already 
offered unprecedented concessions and are willing to negotiate even further but 
we will only accept a deal that is fair to both sides. 

''The owners should either come to the table <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-09" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="should be anchored at speechtime, Dec 8.">now</TIMEX2> and negotiate in good faith to 
end the lockout or take us up on our offer to bring in a mediator who will 
examine the issues from a neutral perspective and help settle the differences. 
There is still <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">enough time to limit the damage caused to our sport</TIMEX2> but only if 
the owners turn constructive rather than destructive.'' 

Hunter said <TIMEX2 val="1998-W49" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> that <TIMEX2 val="1999-01-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Jan. 1</TIMEX2> would be <TIMEX2 val="1999-01-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Jan. 1 would be the date when...">the date when a deal must be imminent 
to salvage <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the season</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. 

Granik responded: ''He might be right. I don't know.'' 

The N.B.A. canceled its All-Star Game <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored">four years to the day after the National 
Hockey League dispensed with its All-Star Game during a labor dispute</TIMEX2>. That work 
stoppage ended on <TIMEX2 val="1995-01-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Jan. 25, 1995, <TIMEX2 val="1995-01-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">12 days after an agreement was reached</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. 

Pointing out that the National Hockey League had held a training camp and filled 
out its rosters with free agents before a lockout was imposed, Stern rejected 
the obvious parallel and repeated that <TIMEX2 val="P1M" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about a month</TIMEX2> would be needed to restart 
<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">any basketball season</TIMEX2>. 

As to what kind of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">season</TIMEX2> that might be, Granik said the league would be willing 
to extend the playoffs until <TIMEX2 val="1999-06" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of June</TIMEX2>, which is <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about 10 days later than 
usual</TIMEX2>, but not <TIMEX2 val="1999-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July</TIMEX2>. 

''The households using television drops off so dramatically as you approach <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Not sure how to tag this one: the weekend occurring nearest (after?) July 4 in any year.">July 
4 weekend</TIMEX2> that I don't think that's a realistic possibility,'' he said. 

What is more, if there is <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a season</TIMEX2>, the younger, running teams may reap 
immediate benefits. Teams may be required to play <TIMEX2 val="P3NI" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three nights in a row</TIMEX2>. Also, 
cross-country travel will be significantly cut down. 

''I would expect, that whatever number of games is agreed upon, you're going to 
see a conference-type schedule with perhaps some mix of interconference games,'' 
Granik said. ''But not every team is going to see every other team at home.''
