HEADLINE:  S.E.C. Warns Banks Against Overgenerous Reserve Levels

When Federal regulators become concerned about how banks account for loans, most 
often they worry that the institutions have not set enough money aside to cover 
expected losses. 

But <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2>, securities regulators said that Suntrust Bank Inc. had done just 
the reverse. The bank had set aside too much money in its reserves, they said. 
In essence, the bank had said in its financial statements that it would not 
collect on some outstanding loans even though they would most likely be paid. 

After talking with regulators, Suntrust agreed to decrease its loan reserves by 
$100 million -- an adjustment that will force the bank to restate earnings for 
<TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2>. After the corrections, earnings in <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="1994, 1995 and 1996">those years</TIMEX2> will spring 
up by a total of $61 million after taxes. 

Regulators are concerned that companies of all types, enjoying booming profits 
in <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent years</TIMEX2>, have been improperly increasing their reserves as a way of 
insulating themselves from shareholder anger when business turns bad. 

By setting aside excessive reserves, a company that later has <TIMEX2 val="P1QX" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a bad quarter</TIMEX2> can 
reach into those reserves for some dollars to tack on to actual earnings so that 
the stock market is not disappointed. The result: the company's financial 
statements do not accurately tell investors what happened. 

James C. Armstrong, a spokesman at Suntrust, said the bank's executives had no 
intention of using the loan reserves to enhance <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-14" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2> earnings. Instead, the 
bank has always been conservative in accounting for loans, he said. 

Mr. Armstrong said the bank and the regulators had simply used different 
assumptions in estimating <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-14" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2> losses. ''Two rational people can take the same 
information,'' he added, ''and come to very different conclusions.'' 

Regulators had been reviewing the financial statements of Suntrust, a large 
Southeastern bank based in Atlanta, because of its proposed merger with the 
Crestar Financial Corporation. Suntrust agreed in <TIMEX2 val="1998-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July</TIMEX2> to acquire Crestar for 
$9.5 billion in stock, creating the nation's 10th-largest banking company. 

In <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last year</TIMEX2>, securities regulators have become worried about what they say 
is a growing number of companies playing games with their numbers. 

In <TIMEX2 val="1998-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September</TIMEX2>, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
condemned the ''accounting hocus-pocus,'' saying that regulators planned to crack 
down on more companies that were bending or breaking the nation's accounting 
rules. One of the problems, he said, was companies creating illusions on their 
books by using unrealistic assumptions to estimate liabilities for loan losses, 
sales returns and warranty costs. 

''They stash accruals in cookie jars during <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the good times</TIMEX2>,'' he said, ''and reach 
into them when needed in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the bad times</TIMEX2>.'' 

It is not only at small companies that the questionable practices are found, Mr. 
Levitt added. ''It's also happening in companies whose products we know and 
admire,'' he said.
