HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., <STORY_REF_TIME>Nov. 2</STORY_REF_TIME> -  
In the Jets' resurgence to a four-way tie atop the American Football Conference 
East, the unheralded defense is playing a critical role. But exactly who are 
these guys who baffled the Kansas City Chiefs and a national television audience 
on Sunday? 

Who exactly is Rick Lyle, the lineman who batted away two Elvis Grbac passes as 
if he were a free safety? Who is Dwayne Gordon, the linebacker who ran back an 
interception for a touchdown? Or Corwin Brown, a backup defensive back who 
intercepted Grbac on the 1-yard line? 

It's simple. They are a collection of bargain-basement free agents. Not a 
million-dollar acquisition among them. Seven starters were acquired during the 
Bill Parcells era. All of them were let go by their previous teams. At least one 
came with some baggage packed with controversy. In fact, since one of those 
players, middle linebacker Pepper Johnson, splits the position with another 
former free agent, Gordon, the Jets are using eight free agents for the bulk of 
the defensive work. 

Yet, for a unit that will never be compared to the Sack Exchange -- it is ranked 
25th in the National Football League in sacks -- the Jets' defense boasts 
favorable numbers: 

*They are co-leaders in the N.F.L. with fewest touchdown passes permitted 
(seven). 

*They rank seventh in the league in yardage allowed; a turnaround after finding 
themselves 30th, and last, after Game 1 at San Francisco. 

*Only four teams in the league have given up fewer points a game than the Jets 
(17.3). 

Not coincidentally, almost all the free agents (Lyle and his fellow linemen 
Ernie Logan and Anthony Pleasant, linebackers Johnson and Bryan Cox, cornerback 
Otis Smith and free safety Jerome Henderson) have a connection with Bill 
Belichick, who runs the defense, and Scott Pioli, whose personnel evaluations 
have been pivotal in the Jets' reversal of fortune. 

The three linemen all played for Belichick in Cleveland, where Pioli was a 
personnel scout. Johnson, who starred under Parcells with the Giants, eventually 
performed in Cleveland under Belichick. Smith and Henderson played for New 
England, where Parcells was head coach and Belichick his top assistant. 

Only Cox and Gordon didn't have a history with the Jets' brain trust, although 
Parcells and Cox often ran into each other at Gulfstream Park race track in 
Florida. Each owned horses. 

Parcells wasn't bothered by Cox's history of being fined by his own teams for 
his outspoken comments or by the league for on-the-field behavior. Cox has 
replaced last season's top draft pick, James Farrior. 

So after half a season, this mostly no-name defense has helped the Jets win five 
of their last six games, and may erase the remaining questions, if there are any 
left, of Parcells's ability to judge talent. 

Asked today about Parcells's success with reclamation projects, Gordon replied: 

''It's just taking chances. I think maybe he sees some things in people that 
others don't. When I came here, one of the first things he said to me, after one 
of our first scrimmages, 'Why didn't you play in San Diego?' Right then and 
there, I knew he appreciated what I could do on the field. He's going to tell 
each and every player what he needs, so there is no confusion. There is no: 'I 
don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't know why I'm not making the trip.' You 
know why and you need to work on correcting that problem so you can go on 
trips.'' 

Smith, for example, was beaten for nine touchdowns last season. He has not been 
touched for one this year. Indeed, he didn't even permit Andre Rison one 
reception in the 20-17 victory at Kansas City. 

Henderson wasn't even starting until two games ago, when an angry Parcells 
benched the rookie Kevin Williams, who was late for a team meeting. Now Parcells 
has decided to leave Henderson in. 

''What we've got going now,'' Lyle said, ''is knowing how to do it -- and to make 
sure we carry it forward.'' 

Brown is one of Parcells's trusted special-teams lieutenants from the Patriots 
days. A year ago, the Jets were winning games with their special teams as the 
offense was trying to establish itself. This season the unit hasn't had a big 
Leon Johnson punt return as it did last year, nor had it generated a crushing 
kickoff -- until Aaron Glenn's 62-yarder on Sunday. 

There has been more pressure on the defense to produce this season, especially 
since the Jets are facing a harder schedule. 

''I think that finally some of the guys are believing we can do it,'' Brown said. 
''I know that the other teams are starting to think so.'' 
  
EXTRA POINTS 

LEON JOHNSON is wearing a soft cast after he sprained his left knee returning a 
kick. The versatile third-down back is unlikely to play on Sunday against 
Buffalo. . . . The Jets are thinking of using the 248-pound fullback JERALD 
SOWELL on third-and-1 or at the goal line. CURTIS MARTIN, for all his success in 
running and catching, has converted only 4 of 10 carries on third-and-1. . . . 
BRIAN HANSEN, with another poor performance (although he was hurt by the 
miserable weather), remains the incumbent. A major factor in keeping him is his 
ability to hold for place-kicker JOHN HALL. . . . In BILL PARCELLS's coaching 
career, his teams have won 88 percent of the games in which a player scored on a 
kick return, fumble or interception. The league average is 68 percent. The Jets 
are 6-2 with returns for scores under Parcells. . . . Next Sunday's game will 
mark only the second pairing of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks in N.F.L. 
history. In the 1970's, ROGER STAUBACH and JIM PLUNKETT faced each other three 
times.
