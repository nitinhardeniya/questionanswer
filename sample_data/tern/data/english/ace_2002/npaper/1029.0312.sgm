It was the first taste of a voyage to space for dozens of students at Public 
School 87 on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where two fifth-grade classes and 
a first-grade class gathered in front of a television to watch John Glenn blast 
into space for the second time. 

There was some fidgeting as the children -- who did not get quite the same 
charge out of Walter Cronkite that adults of a certain age do -- waited for the 
anchors to stop talking and the countdown to begin. 

''Let's just pretend it's a Yankees game,'' one boy remarked. 

Across the New York area yesterday, students took a break from their computer 
screens and books to catch a glimpse of Mr. Glenn's second launching into space. 
Of course, in this age of technology, there was hardly the excitement of 36 
years ago, when Mr. Glenn first took off. 

In fact, only a few schools took special notice of the occasion, driven by 
teachers and administrators who were there the first time around. 

At P.S. 87, Steven Plaut, the principal, turned the sound off on the television 
as the children waited for the launching and tried to calm them with a little 
history lesson. He evoked Sputnik and the race for space. 

''There was a President of the U.S. who really made a commitment to the country 
that before the end of the 20th century, we were going to have a man on the 
moon,'' he said. ''Does anybody know who that was?'' 

''Kennedy,'' a boy cried out. 

Evoking Columbus, Mr. Plaut then asked about the first explorer on the Moon. 
''Neil Armstrong,'' a girl replied. 

''Shhhh's'' filled the room as the final countdown began. Carried away by the 
suspense of it all, the children began shouting out the waning seconds. As the 
shuttle lifted off, they cheered and pumped their fists. It could, after all, 
have been a Yankees game. 

''I want to learn more about John Glenn,'' Samuel Haile, a fifth-grader, said when 
it was over. ''He's brave.''
