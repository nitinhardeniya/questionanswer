WASHINGTON, <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment=""><STORY_REF_TIME>Dec. 5</STORY_REF_TIME></TIMEX2> -  
Milton Kaufman never planned on a Government career when he was growing up in 
Coney Island in <TIMEX2 val="192" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1920's</TIMEX2>. Working at Steeplechase amusement park, he dreamed 
of becoming a mathematics teacher. But after he graduated from the City 
University of New York with a master's degree in mathematics in <TIMEX2 val="1933" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1933</TIMEX2>, the 
Government was the only place hiring. Schools could not afford to hire new 
teachers in the Depression. 

''When I graduated from college, I couldn't get a job anywhere else,'' Mr. Kaufman 
said. 

A tall, gentle man, who wears a suit and tie on the job and off, Mr. Kaufman 
retired <TIMEX2 val="1998-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this fall</TIMEX2> after <TIMEX2 val="P64Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-FA" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">64 years of service at the Census Bureau</TIMEX2>. He shared the 
distinction of having the longest tenure of any active Federal employee, 
according to the Commerce Department. 

With a sharp memory for dates and, not surprisingly, numbers, he is quick to 
recount <TIMEX2 val="P64Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-FA" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">his years of service in the Government</TIMEX2>, recalling <TIMEX2 val="194X-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">specific days</TIMEX2> and 
<TIMEX2 val="194X-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">months from <TIMEX2 val="194" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1940's</TIMEX2></TIMEX2> as if they were <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day before <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. 

His first job in <TIMEX2 val="1933" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1933</TIMEX2> was for the Works Progress Administration, an agency 
created under President Franklin D. Roosevelt to preserve job skills and lower 
the country's unemployment rate. Mr. Kaufman and about 100 other mathematicians 
conducted actuarial work for the Government, at $18 <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="should this be anchored AFTER 1933?">a week</TIMEX2>. 

On <TIMEX2 val="1934-07-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July 1, 1934</TIMEX2>, he was hired by the Census Bureau, part of the Commerce 
Department, and officially became a Government employee. His <TIMEX2 val="P64Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">64-year</TIMEX2> tenure is 
counted from <TIMEX2 val="1934-07-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">then</TIMEX2>. 

While he worked at the Census Bureau, the United States' population more than 
doubled, rising to 270,913,356 when he retired from 126,373,773 in <TIMEX2 val="1934" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1934</TIMEX2>. More 
than 80 percent of the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> population was not yet born when Mr. Kaufman, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> 
87, was hired by the bureau. 

Mr. Kaufman moved to the bureau's newly formed Foreign Trade Division in <TIMEX2 val="1942" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1942</TIMEX2>. 
During World War II, one of his first assignments was to help prepare a 
classified report with a detailed listing of export cargo on vessels sunk by the 
enemy. 

''Most of the operations during the War were part of the Lend-Lease program, 
giving cargo to allies,'' he said. ''Russia still owes us billions of dollars they 
haven't paid back.'' 

After the war, Mr. Kaufman's files were photographed and sent to Russia and 
archives in the United States. The United States Government hopes that someday 
the report will ''be used to get the payment back,'' Mr. Kaufman said, ''but I 
won't live to see that.'' 

The bureau's statistics, <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Sometime after 1942">then</TIMEX2>, were tabulated by a machine, the Remington Rand 
tabulator, a predecessor to the I.B.M. computers statisticians use <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, Mr. 
Kaufman said. In <TIMEX2 val="195" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1950's</TIMEX2>, the Census Bureau made calculations on a Univac 
computer that took up an entire room. 

Mr. Kaufman's work at the bureau focused on economic indicators to calculate the 
balance of trade in goods and services. He collected numbers to compile 
indicators of the country's exports and imports. He rose to the rank of senior 
foreign trade statistician. 

After working for <TIMEX2 val="P.66CE" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">nearly two-thirds of a century</TIMEX2>, Mr. Kaufman seems surprised to 
find that he enjoys his retirement, and his wife, also in her 80's, is getting 
used to having him around the house more. But if he had not had a heart attack 
<TIMEX2 val="1997-06" mod="AFTER" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">almost a year and a half ago</TIMEX2>, he says, he probably would have continued to work. 
''I'd have no reason to stop,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''No Florida for me.''
