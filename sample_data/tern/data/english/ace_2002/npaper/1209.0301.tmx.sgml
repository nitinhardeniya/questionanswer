UNITED NATIONS, <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment=""><STORY_REF_TIME>Dec. 9</STORY_REF_TIME></TIMEX2> -  
For the first time in <TIMEX2 val="P.5CE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">more than half a century</TIMEX2>, the United Nations General 
Assembly decided <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> to list anti-Semitism as a form of racism. 

The resolution was adopted by consensus on <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 50th anniversary of the 
international convention against genocide</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored - pragmatically reference to Dec. 9.">a day before the United Nations 
celebrates <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="assuming the celebration is the same day as the anniversary">the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. 

In a resolution introduced by Indonesia on behalf of more than 100 developing 
nations, the Assembly also warned against new avenues for disseminating the 
''repugnant views'' of racist organizations, and asked governments to monitor 
communications for misuse. 

General Assembly resolutions do not carry the force of Security Council 
resolutions, but they reflect world opinion. In <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-09" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the past</TIMEX2>, the Assembly had voted 
to equate Zionism with racism. 

After the cold war ended, the United States was able to have those definitions 
removed from <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> Assembly resolutions on human rights. <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This year</TIMEX2> the Clinton 
Administration lobbied hard to include a condemnation of anti-Semitism in the 
resolution. 

''The U.N. is about tolerance and inclusion,'' said Felice Gaer, director of Jacob 
Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, at the American Jewish 
Committee. ''But this is the first time that the U.N. has used the phrase 
'anti-Semitism,' which has been fought over for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">years</TIMEX2> and kept out of any 
resolutions.'' 

The phrase just narrowly made it. In a paragraph whose language Geraldine 
Ferraro helped negotiate <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four years ago</TIMEX2> when she was the chief American 
representative at the United Nations Human Rights Commission, the General 
Assembly listed a number of targets to be investigated by the United Nations 
monitor on racism. 

The monitor was asked to examine racist incidents ''against blacks, Arabs and 
Muslims'' and ''xenophobia, Negrophobia, anti-Semitism and related intolerance.'' 

Secretary General Kofi Annan has lent his voice to broadening definitions of 
intolerance, and for changes in the attitude of members toward Israel, which is 
still denied a place in any of the organization's regional groups. It is these 
groups that choose candidates for rotating Security Council seats and other 
positions. 

In a speech in <TIMEX2 val="1998-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">March</TIMEX2> in Jerusalem to the Israel Foreign Relations Council and 
the United Nations Association of Israel, Mr. Annan said he was aware that ''the 
United Nations is regarded by many as biased against the State of Israel.'' 

''I know that Israelis see hypocrisy and double standards in the intense scrutiny 
given to some of its actions, while other situations fail to elicit the world's 
outrage and condemnations,'' he said. ''I know that Israelis are offended when 
other nations' delegates leave the room as Israelis rise to speak.'' 

Mr. Annan said it was time for ''<TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a new era of relations between Israel and the 
United Nations</TIMEX2>.''
