WITHIN three seconds of logging on to America Online from her room on the Upper 
East Side in Manhattan, Debbie Shapiro, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, got 
an instant message from her best friend's brother's college roommate, who was on 
his dormitory room computer. 

''Hey there, Deb,'' the message flashed, as the twinkle sound that accompanies 
every instant message alerted her to check her screen. ''Hey,'' she fired back, 
rolling her eyes. ''This guy is always bugging me,'' she said to a companion. ''I 
don't know why. I have nothing to say to him.'' 

Before long, Debbie's computer screen was peppered with several more instant 
messages -- one from a friend wanting to know if any jocks had been at the party 
Debbie went to the night before, one from a classmate inquiring about math 
homework and one from a friend just wondering what was up. For the next 
half-hour, Debbie performed an epistolary juggling act that had her holding four 
different on-line conversations simultaneously. When Debbie's best friend 
called, Debbie picked up the cordless phone next to her computer, cradled it 
between her ear and shoulder to talk and continued typing. 

In the age of the household with a computer and multiple phone lines, the 
teen-ager who years ago would have secreted herself away in the closet with her 
Princess phone now has vastly expanded communications, thanks to America Online 
or other instant-message services. 

AOL began offering instant messages as soon as it signed up its first members, 
in 1985. But the service has now moved as far into the mainstream as MTV because 
it has been letting people outside AOL sign up for Instant Messenger since May 
1997. At that point, 100 million instant messages were being sent by AOL members 
each day. Now that the service is open and free for anyone, AOL says, the number 
of daily messages is 200 million. 

Interviews with scores of teen-agers showed that AOL's Instant Messenger is 
indeed popular among that age group. And although adults debate whether 
impressionable adolescents should have unregulated Internet access, the main 
thing teen-agers seem to do when they log on for instant messages is use their 
keyboards to talk to their friends. It is difficult to move beyond anecdotal 
evidence of this phenomenon to specific numbers. AOL does not track the way 
teen-agers use the service. 

But many parents can testify that all of a house's telephone lines can be 
monopolized for hours at a time by teen-agers chatting on computers and 
telephones. 

''Our peak hours are 8 to 11 P.M.,'' said an AOL spokeswoman, Pam McGraw. ''But we 
do know that when kids get home from school, they have a tendency to sign on and 
chat with their friends, just like they normally would have talked on the phone 
in the past.'' 

AOL added its Buddy List to Instant Messenger in February 1996, and that has 
contributed to the huge increase in instant messaging among the under-18 set. 
Your Buddy List includes the on-line names of the people you want to exchange 
instant messages with; you are notified each time a person on your list goes on 
line, and those on your list are told when you go on line. Before the advent of 
the Buddy List, you had to type in someone's name to find out if that person was 
on line. 

Similar lists are now offered by other chat and instant-message services, like 
those offered by Yahoo, Excite, ICQ, Internet Relay Chat and Pow Wow. One reason 
for AOL's popularity among teen-agers may be the fact that a majority of parents 
with Internet access have AOL accounts. 

What urgent missives are imparted via instant messages that can't wait until the 
next school day? ''We complain about school mostly, and teachers and guys,'' said 
Sara Mulnix, a high school sophomore from Herndon, Va., whose Buddy List runs 83 
names long. She said she spent two to three hours a week on line with friends. 

Jacob Scott, 16, from Reading, Mass., said: ''I I-M friends about various social 
dilemmas, and all other kinds of craziness. It's a quicker way to get answers 
than calling someone on the phone.'' 

Some teen-agers use instant messages strictly to keep in touch with friends from 
summer camps or catch up with friends from old neighborhoods. ''I go on, read my 
mail, write back a couple of sentences and get off,'' said Sara Shepard, a 
sophomore at Trinity High School in New York City. ''I used to be much more into 
it, but I don't have the time anymore.'' 

For other teen-agers, however, AOL's Instant Messenger system is nearly as 
important as the telephone. 

''It's a big social tool,'' said Jocelyn Nubel, 15, of Northport, N.Y., adding 
that virtually everyone she knew at school and in her town had access to AOL's 
Instant Messenger. ''To some extent, it takes the place of the phone. We'll all 
be at a party and when we leave, we say, 'Bye, see you guys on AOL.' Then when I 
get home, at like 1 o'clock, I'll go on line and get all these instant messages. 
People asking me, 'Did you have fun tonight?' 'Who did you go with?' and 'Did 
you hear about so-and-so?' '' 

Jocelyn said it was easier to approach boys on line than on the phone. ''You 
don't have to deal with the awkwardness of phone silence when you 
instant-message someone,'' she said. ''When you call someone, it's more personal. 
If I I-M someone, it's not such a big deal because that's what everybody does. 
You can get the general stuff about each other out of the way so when you see 
him, it's easier to start talking.'' 

Teen-agers who frequently send instant messages often find it more helpful than 
the phone for negotiating problems with friends. ''I'm not good at confronting 
people,'' Sara Mulnix said. ''On the phone, you have to worry about someone's 
sarcastic response to what you're saying. When you type it out, you have 
unlimited space to let it all go.'' 

Jacob Scott prefers sending instant messages to talking on the phone for similar 
reasons. ''People act very differently on line than they do in real life,'' he 
said. ''Everyone seems a little more thoughtful, maybe because the conversation 
is a little slower. The best thing about talking on line is that you can look at 
what you're saying before you send it and ask yourself, 'Do I really mean this?' 
'' 

But it is not all heartfelt earnestness on line, Jacob was quick to point out. 
Last year, he said, he and his track teammates engaged in ''electronic warfare'' 
when Reading High School lost the finals for the first time in 27 years to 
nearby Woburn. ''We went into AOL's Member Profiles, typed in ''Woburn'' and 
''Track,'' and sent harassing messages to a lot of Woburn kids. It got to be an 
all-out war.'' 

Teen-agers also use chat rooms to talk to one another on line. Hundreds of Web 
chat rooms oriented toward teen-agers require little more than a screen name and 
a password to sign up. Susan Herring, a linguistics professor at the University 
of Texas at Arlington who recently completed a yearlong study, was surprised to 
find that even though chat rooms afforded teen-agers a relatively new medium for 
communication, sex roles remain extremely traditional. 

The chats Dr. Herring surveyed inevitably moved in one of several directions, 
she said. ''There was the chivalry scenario, where a boy will rush to the 
protection of a girl, do battle verbally with the other boys and then proceed to 
woo the girl,'' she said. ''Then there was the 'belle of the ball' scenario, where 
a lone girl in a chat room full of boys will play the part of queen bee, 
demanding that all the boys court her. 

''Maybe it's because they can't see each other in a chat room, but you usually 
don't have to wait beyond four or five lines before there's some expression of 
gender or sexual identity.'' 

What is to be gained from all this chitchat? Dr. Herring (who said she had not 
even been allowed to call boys on the phone when she was growing up), said 
computer chats, especially those in chat rooms with many participants, were 
simply another tool for social interaction. ''The closest approximation would be 
to imagine a large social event, such as a party, where multiple conversations 
are taking place at the same time, equally audible to all participants,'' she 
said. ''The Internet just creates a lot more opportunities for this to happen.'' 

Like many parents of teen-agers who spend a lot of time on AOL's instant-message 
service, Susan Mulnix, Sara's mother, is a little bewildered by her daughter's 
zealous keyboard conversations. ''It tends to be on the soap opera level,'' she 
said. ''It's very 'he said this' and 'she did that.' '' But she also said her 
daughter was closer to her friends than Ms. Mulnix had been with hers growing 
up, partly because of the freedom that on-line conversation allowed. 

''They're able to say things to each other that we never would have in person,'' 
Ms. Mulnix said. ''Instant messages and chat rooms are a little like riding in 
the car with your mother. You're not looking at each other, so it's easier to 
say things you wouldn't otherwise bring up.'' 

Not surprisingly, Ms. Mulnix has concerns about how worthwhile talking on line 
to friends for hours on end can possibly be. Since the school year started, she 
has tried to keep Sara from going on line until she has finished her homework. 
''But that's hard,'' Ms. Mulnix said, ''because unlike the phone, I can't hear her 
talking.''
