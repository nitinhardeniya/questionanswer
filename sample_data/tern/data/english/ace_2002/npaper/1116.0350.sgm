Hours after his swift emergence last week as the presumptive new Speaker of the 
House, Representative Bob Livingston telephoned an old friend, former 
Representative Jimmy Hayes, for advice. He did not ask Mr. Hayes how best to 
keep his Republican flock in line, or for counsel on issues. Instead, he quizzed 
his fellow Louisiana Republican about how he could best build a relationship 
with Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader. 

''He said, 'Tell me about Dick Gephardt the person,' '' recalled Mr. Hayes, a 
onetime Democrat who is close to both men. '' 'I want to know more about this 
guy.' Livingston was saying, 'I know he listens great. I want him to talk more.' 
'' 

That Mr. Livingston wants to talk at all to Mr. Gephardt, who hungers for his 
job, underscores the bipartisan, accommodationist approach of the new leader. 
The man Mr. Livingston will replace, Newt Gingrich, had considered Mr. Gephardt 
so irrelevant that he rarely spoke to him. 

Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Livingston, both Tulane graduates, are vastly different. 
While Mr. Gingrich built his career as a partisan rebel, Mr. Livingston has 
always reached across the aisle. Both are conservatives, but Mr. Gingrich is 
ideological, while Mr. Livingston, his former protege, is pragmatic. While Mr. 
Gingrich has called himself ''a transformational leader,'' Mr. Livingston is not 
known for his vision, intellect or ego, and until he was elevated to chairman of 
the Appropriations Committee, was not thought a heavyweight in Washington, or 
back home. 

''I'll bet there are a lot of people in New Orleans, still, who wouldn't even 
recognize him if you showed them Livingston's picture,'' said Ed Renwick, who 
heads the Institute of Politics at Loyola University. 

In an era in which Speakers have been defined by belligerent partisanship -- 
particularly Mr. Gingrich and the Democrat he hounded from office, Jim Wright of 
Texas -- Mr. Livingston represents an older strain of conservatism. 

While Mr. Wright and Mr. Gingrich were tainted by scandal, Mr. Livingston has 
not been. And while Mr. Gingrich had long predicted greatness for himself, and 
plotted for years to become Speaker, there are no such stories about Mr. 
Livingston. ''I don't think it ever entered his head,'' said Fred Carroll, an 
investment banker and a friend for more than 40 years. 

Mr. Livingston is perhaps best known on Capitol Hill for his incendiary 
outbursts on the House floor and in private meetings (he cools down quickly). 
''He has a huge temper,'' said Representative W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, another 
Louisiana Republican. ''He's going to have to learn to use it and control it. '' 

The incoming Speaker has a gift for timing, a relentless and plodding nature and 
a gangly, even awkward demeanor that has led many to underestimate him. Even his 
closest friends say they never considered him likely to become one of the most 
powerful men in the nation, deciding the agenda and schedule for the House of 
Representatives. 

''This is a guy who has been there at the right time, time after time, and he's 
always taken advantage of it,'' said John Bolles, a former classmate and friend 
for decades. ''This is not a terribly complicated guy. This is not a guy with a 
lot of hidden agendas. He's got a good, healthy ego, but no delusions of 
grandeur.'' 
  
Single-Minded Dedication To What He Wants 


Mr. Livingston, who has represented Louisiana's relatively affluent First 
District since 1977, pursues what he wants with the same single-mindedness that 
he brings to his hobbies: playing the harmonica, doing impersonations and 
becoming a black belt in Tae Kwan Do. 

''When he got that black belt, in the first minute of the test he broke his big 
toe on a board but he just kept right on going,'' said Quin Hillyer, an editorial 
writer at The Mobile (Ala.) Register, who was the Congressman's press secretary. 
''You know how painful that is? He's tough. He's got a very strong will.'' 

Mr. Livingston has carried that strong will to Congress. He was appalled when 
the Federal Election Commission conducted a random audit of his first successful 
campaign. Ever since, he has crusaded against the agency, slashing staff members 
and starting investigations. 

With similar zeal, Mr. Livingston sought the Speakership. Earlier this year, he 
announced that he would seek the post whenever Mr. Gingrich stepped aside. But 
in the wake of the Republicans' net loss of five House seats on Nov. 3, Mr. 
Livingston turned on his mentor. 

''He's going to meet with us more often and talk about process,'' Mr. Gephardt 
said of his new sparring partner. But the Democratic leader, in perhaps an 
unintended compliment to Mr. Gingrich, said: ''Newt's great strengths were that 
he had both a vision and an ideology and a set of issues and thinking that he 
could express, at least to some people, in a compelling way -- and that's 
important in a leader. You have to be able to express ideas. And I don't know 
whether Bob can do that.'' 
  
Overcoming Departure Of His Father 


Robert Linlithgow Livingston, 55, was born in Colorado Springs, Colo., where his 
mother's family lived. The family settled in New Orleans, where his father took 
a job with National Distillers. The job did not last long, and neither did the 
marriage. 

In 1951, when Robert (''It wasn't until he became a politician that he became 
Bob,'' Mr. Carroll said) was 7, his father walked out on the family. ''He turned 
out to be an alcoholic,'' said Mr. Livingston's mother, Dorothy Billet, who 
remarried after her son and daughter grew up. She stayed in New Orleans and 
found a job at the Avondale Shipyards. 

Mrs. Billet later learned that her first husband had settled in Spain and died 
at 55. ''Of course, Robert was very upset by his father going away like that,'' 
she said. 

Friends, though, said the young man rarely mentioned it. ''I'm sure it had a 
negative impact,'' Mr. Bolles said. ''But he never talked about it.'' 

Mrs. Billet settled Robert and his younger sister into a modest home in New 
Orleans's Uptown neighborhood, a couple of blocks from Tulane University. One 
important effect of the departure of Robert's father was that the family was 
always strapped. Young Robert helped out financially. Always among the youngest 
and tallest in his class, Robert Livingston was a shy boy, Mrs. Billet said. ''I 
remember when he was 124 pounds and 6 foot 4,'' she said. ''He wanted to be the 
athletic type. He really wanted to be. But he was always a year behind in 
athletics.'' 

Mrs. Billet, an Episcopalian, received partial church scholarships for her 
children that allowed them to attend St. Martins Episcopal School, one of New 
Orleans's most prestigious schools. At 14, Mr. Livingston worked cleaning up 
after elephants at the New Orleans Zoo. For several summers, he earned college 
money at the Avondale Shipyards, ending up as a welder's assistant. 

After Mr. Livingston, like many of his Uptown friends, settled on Tulane, his 
life nearly came unstuck. ''He went to college and got in with a group of guys 
who liked to party, including me,'' Mr. Bolles said. Mr. Livingston joined the 
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. 

After only one year, Mr. Livingston was asked in 1961 to take a sabbatical by 
Tulane officials who complained about excessive party-going, Mr. Bolles said. 

Mr. Livingston joined the Navy, serving for two years, and returned a changed 
man. ''The Navy straightened him out,'' Mr. Bolles said. ''He kept on partying with 
us, but he was more able to handle the partying and the classes together. He had 
more confidence, was more focused.'' He began to talk about law school. 

Mr. Livingston also met and married Bonnie Robichaux, a Lousisiana State 
University student. They have three sons and a daughter. 

In 1968, Mr. Livingston graduated from Tulane's law school and took a job at a 
law firm whose partners included David Treen, a Republican later elected 
Governor. ''He was interested in a political career right from the beginning,'' 
Mr. Treen said. 

Mr. Treen said he advised Mr. Livingston to establish himself in some career 
before running for office. The young man agreed and, after two years with the 
firm, asked Mr. Treen to help him get a job as an Assistant United States 
Attorney. 

The hard living continued, his friends said, for he would often go out drinking 
in the French Quarter to celebrate a victory or unwind. Late one night, Mr. 
Livingston came home to find that his wife had neatly placed his dinner -- the 
entire place setting, from water glass to cutlery -- on the front step, where it 
was swarming with vermin. Friends said the incident helped slow down the fast 
life. 

When a seat opened in the First Congressional District in 1976, Mr. Livingston 
was not the Republican establishment's first choice. But after one potential 
candidate developed financial difficulties and a second declined to switch 
parties, the Republicans approached Mr. Livingston, who eagerly agreed to run. 

He was defeated by a Democrat who, within months, was investigated and 
eventually jailed for campaign finance irregularities. In a special election in 
1977, Mr. Livingston, untainted and fresh in the voters' minds, easily won 
election to the seat he has held ever since. 

The only other race Mr. Livingston lost was when he ran for governor in 1987. 
Even then his accommodationist inclinations were apparent. After bitter contest 
in which Mr. Livingston and a rival, Mr. Tauzin, who was then serving in the 
House as a Democrat, lost in their parties' primaries, Mr. Livingston took the 
unheard of step of raising money to help pay off Mr. Tauzin's debt. ''Bob felt it 
would be the right thing to do because it was not good for a member of our 
delegation to be so preoccupied with debt,'' said Mr. Tauzin, who became a 
Republican years later. 
  
From Money Plan To Power Play 


Mr. Livingston had planned to retire from Congress this year to make more money 
as a lobbyist. But Mr. Gingrich was among those who persuaded him to stay. And 
Mr. Livingston would never have been in a position to drive Mr. Gingrich from 
office had the Speaker not chosen him over others with more seniority in 1994 to 
preside over Federal spending as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 

He has been a tough-minded chairman, battling Democrats who want to spend more 
as well as Republicans who want to deliver projects to their districts. He 
displayed his bipartisan bona fides -- and outraged some conservatives -- by 
keeping on the staff several Democrats who had worked there before the 
Republicans took over Congress in 1994. 

Yet Mr. Livingston did not waver from traditional Republican goals, like 
slashing billions of dollars from the Federal budget and eliminating hundreds of 
programs, while resisting reductions in military spending. 

''I wouldn't call him a social activist,'' said Jimmy Hayes, the former 
Congressman. ''The only theme that fits Bob is the fiscal conservatism.'' 

As he angled to move up the hierarchy, Mr. Livingston formed his own political 
action committee, dutifully raising money for colleagues. 

While he collected hefty donations from the oil and gas industries back home, 
his more generous benefactors have been aerospace and military and 
transportation companies. 

Mr. Livingston also became known for quickly getting to the bottom line. 
Representative Joe Scarborough, a Florida Republican, recalled being dressed 
down after he opposed increased spending for House 
operations and delivered a speech that was criticized as 
self-righteous. 

''He told me he was offended by my speech and basically told me that I needed to 
work with the team -- or not expect the team to work for me,'' Mr. Scarborough 
said. ''I respect somebody who tells me straight instead of someone smiling, 
patting me on the back, and then trying to do me in. 

When Mr. Gingrich named Mr. Livingston to head the committee, they had struck an 
implicit bargain: The new chairman would work with the leadership. But as time 
wore on, Mr. Livingston began to chafe at the Speaker's tight rein. 

In what amounted to a cry for a return to the tradition of powerful barons 
presiding over their committees, Mr. Livingston wrote Mr. Gingrich three days 
after the election, outlining 15 demands, including the freedom to ''run the 
committee as I see fit.'' 

Hours later, Mr. Gingrich announced his resignation, pushed out by his 
once-loyal protege. Now, it will be Mr. Livingston's turn to run the House and, 
like his predecessor, to try his hand at the ultimate challenge: building a 
record of legislative accomplishment while satisfying a chamber of restive 
partisans.
