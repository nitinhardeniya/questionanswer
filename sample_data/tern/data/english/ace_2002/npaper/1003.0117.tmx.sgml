ARLINGTON, TEX., <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment=""><STORY_REF_TIME>OCT. 3</STORY_REF_TIME></TIMEX2> -  
Tim Raines shouted for some attention, shouted in such a shrill fashion that 
Manager Joe Torre thought one of his players had been injured during a clubhouse 
celebration. But no one was hurt. Raines simply wanted everyone to listen to him 
as he climbed on a wooden table and toasted a missing friend. 

''Everyone knows we wanted to win this thing for Darryl Strawberry,'' said Raines, 
clutching a bottle of champagne and addressing his Yankees teammates. ''This one 
is for you D. Strawberry.'' 

The Yankees screeched in Strawberry's honor, barking his name and showering 
Raines in beer and champagne. The Yankees had just finished <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-02TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a draining evening</TIMEX2> 
with a 4-0 decision over the Rangers and a three-game sweep of the division 
series. But they had Darryl on their minds and in their hearts. Disparate 
emotions will continue dominating the Yankees as they pursue a World Series 
title <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every day</TIMEX2> and pray for a teammate <TIMEX2 val="TXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every hour</TIMEX2>. At least. 

Strawberry underwent surgery for colon cancer <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, and the 
Yankees said they wanted him to go to sleep <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-02TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="reference time shifts here to speech time of Friday night after the game.">Friday night</TIMEX2> knowing that the team 
had advanced to the American League Championship Series. A rain delay of <TIMEX2 val="PT3H16M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-02" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">3 hours 
16 minutes</TIMEX2> may have made that unlikely, but the victory was sufficient for the 
Yankees and surely for Strawberry, too. 

''We wanted to do this for Darryl,'' Joe Girardi said. ''We didn't want him to have 
to wait to see what happened until after his surgery. So this was for Darryl. 
But we have a long way to go. Darryl is going to be mad if we stop here.'' 

Rubbing the sticky champagne out of his matted hair, Tino Martinez paused amid 
the boisterousness and added, ''Even <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-03" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, everybody on this team is thinking 
about him.'' 

Although the Yankees had been emotionally wasted ever since Strawberry's cancer 
was diagnosed on <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, and they were probably relieved to celebrate 
fervently, in some ways it was an awkward scene. <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-02TXX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Less than 12 hours before 
Strawberry's surgery</TIMEX2>, the Yankees were pulling bottles of champagne from a 
cooler and cans of beer from three tubs and spraying the alcohol like 
4-year-olds discovering water pistols for the first time. But were the 
histrionics necessary? Should the Yankees, a team that was supposed to win 
anyway, have been more subdued because of Strawberry's delicate situation? 

''I think they needed to let loose,'' Torre said. ''There's been a lot of tension 
here. I just think they have a lot of stuff inside. I think this was good 
therapy.'' 

Chili Davis said no players thought of minimizing the celebration. 

''If Darryl were here, he'd be celebrating with us,'' Davis said. ''Even if he's 
not here, he wants us to celebrate. He gave us the message <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> to go get them, 
to finish it off and to come on back home. We did exactly that. We're 
celebrating not only because we won, but also in his honor.'' 

Davis was referring to a <TIMEX2 val="PT45S" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">45-second</TIMEX2> videotaped message from Strawberry, which the 
Yankees viewed before batting practice on <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>. Strawberry ended the message 
by pointing his finger at the camera and declaring: ''Go get 'em <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-02TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, guys. 
Get 'em.'' 

The Yankees obliged and then lauded Strawberry for motivating them, something a 
team with 117 victories and a possible date with destiny probably does not need. 


''Straw ordered us to win,'' Paul O'Neill reminded Raines. 

Raines smiled and responded, ''The man said take care of it and we did.'' 

When the clubhouse first opened to reporters, David Cone hollered: ''It gets 
better every time, boys. The next round will be even better.'' That started <TIMEX2 val="PT30M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-03" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">30 
minutes of drenching and dousing</TIMEX2>. Mike Stanton scooped up a bottle of the Korbel 
and dryly said: ''First round, it's $8 a bottle. The second round, it'll be $12 a 
bottle.'' 

Still, when the Yankees were asked about Strawberry, the corks were put back in 
the champagne and reality replaced rowdiness. 

''We're pretty much a family,'' Derek Jeter said. ''What he's going through, 
everyone is going through. He's like a big brother to me.'' 

Cone said: ''It affected me as much as anyone. Darryl and I have been together <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="vague duration">a 
long time</TIMEX2>. It shocked me. I didn't sleep well <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-02TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Should be 1998-10-01TNI based on speechtime of 10-02.">last night</TIMEX2>. I don't imagine I'll 
sleep too well <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-03TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Should be 1998-10-02NI based on speechtime of Friday 10-02">tonight</TIMEX2> either.'' 

Cone said a group of players might try to visit Strawberry at the hospital on 
<TIMEX2 val="1998-10-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> if he can receive visitors. 

The Yankees maintained a locker for Strawberry at the Ballpark in Arlington, 
with his uniform, gloves and cleats, despite knowing that he would not be 
joining them any time soon. O'Neill stood next to Strawberry's locker <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-03" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early 
today</TIMEX2> and spoke in reverent tones about the teammate all the Yankees want to see 
healthy and back with them. 

''We saw that message,'' O'Neill said. ''That kind of tugs at your heart a little 
bit. This is a good friend of everybody's. Obviously, the important thing is he 
gets this taken care of and gets on his road to recovery. Then he can be a part 
of celebrating when this is all over. He's still a big part of this team.''
