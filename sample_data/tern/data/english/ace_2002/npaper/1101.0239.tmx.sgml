New Jersey residents will vote <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2> on a proposed constitutional amendment 
that would allow $1 billion in borrowing to protect half of the state's 
remaining two million acres of undeveloped land over <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next 10 years</TIMEX2>. We urge 
them to approve this measure, which represents Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's 
latest effort to preserve the state's threatened farmlands and other open space. 


<TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Earlier this year</TIMEX2>, Republican legislative leaders rejected her first idea, a 
slight increase in New Jersey's relatively low gasoline tax. The new proposal 
requires no new taxes but, instead, would earmark $98 million <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year</TIMEX2> in existing 
sales tax revenues for land preservation and for the repayment of the principal 
and interest on bonds issued for the same purpose. 

The measure is fully consistent with New Jersey's honorable record of preserving 
farmland, creating parks and otherwise protecting open space. Its passage would 
mean that almost two-fifths of the state would be protected for <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-02" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2> 
generations. The initiative has already won support from New Jersey's 
legislators and <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-02" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> deserves approval from its voters.
