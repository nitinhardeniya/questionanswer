HEADLINE:  U.S. Diplomat Pleads for Political Solution to Civil War in Congo

NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov. 4 -  
A top American diplomat ended a weeklong trip to Africa today by again urging a 
political solution to the war in Congo, which has drawn in neighboring countries 
and threatens to widen into a larger regional conflict. 

''There is a strong desire on the part of literally everyone we talked to for 
peace,'' the diplomat, Susan E. Rice, Assistant Secretary of State for African 
Affairs, said this evening in a telephone interview from Zambia. ''The 
frustrating aspect, and the irony, is that as much as everyone wants peace, 
everybody is prepared to keep fighting unless peace can be found on the basis of 
a formula that all find broadly acceptable.'' 

The open question after her at-times stormy visit to seven African countries, 
five of which are fighting in Congo or are widely suspected to be involved, is 
what exactly might create that peace. Ms. Rice emphasized again that devising 
such a plan was not the goal of trip, which she said was purely ''consultative.'' 

In fact the delegation pointedly avoided any public discussion of concrete 
solutions, saying it broadly supported efforts by other African nations like 
South Africa and Zambia for a cease-fire and the removal of foreign troops. 

''I know it's hard to envision, but we really did not come here with a fantasy 
that we're going to shake our finger at these actors and tie this thing up in a 
bow,'' said Gayle E. Smith, senior director for African Affairs at the National 
Security Council, who traveled with Ms. Rice. 

The rebellion in Congo, formerly known as Zaire, began on Aug. 2. From the start 
it was not confined to the forces that were trying to overthrow President 
Laurent Kabila, who took power in a similar rebellion last year. It is almost 
universally assumed that neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are involved, in part to 
secure their borders from rebel groups based in Congo. 

Uganda concedes it has troops in Congo to protect its borders, but denies a role 
in the rebellion. Rwanda has completely denied involvement. 

Mr. Kabila has cast the rebellion as an ''invasion'' by those two nations and 
found military support from Angola, Namibia, Chad and, particularly, Zimbabwe, 
which has sent several thousand combat troops. President Robert Mugabe has 
seemed ever more militant about the role of Zimbabwe in Congo, even though he 
faced huge protests at home against that effort. 

Several rounds of peace talks have failed, and Mr. Kabila refuses to speak with 
the rebels, who call themselves the Congolese Rally for Democracy. Today the 
Foreign Minister of South Africa, which has been promoting a peace plan, warned 
that the situation was becoming graver. 

''If this conflict is not stopped the danger of a massive African war is a 
reality,'' Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said in Cape Town. 

On Friday, President Nelson Mandela is to hold another meeting with the most 
powerful politician in Rwanda, Vice President Paul Kagame, and will reportedly 
push for a plan that calls for Rwanda to admit its role. That admission, 
according to published reports, would be aimed at a cease-fire, followed by the 
withdrawal of foreign troops and the arrival of a peacekeeping force that would 
help protect the Uganda and Rwanda borders. 

The American delegation has not endorsed any particular plan. Ms. Rice said her 
role was more to listen to each nation and repeat what the United States has 
said from the start were its base-line goals, a cease-fire and the withdrawal of 
foreign troops.
