FORT WAYNE, Ind., <STORY_REF_TIME>Nov. 6</STORY_REF_TIME> -  
On Oct. 30, children, teen-agers and adults packed the balcony overlooking the 
gymnasium floor at the Indiana Institute of Technology to watch the Fort Wayne 
Fury practice. Excited fans jockeyed for position, standing on tiptoe and 
pushing one another aside to videotape and photograph the action on the court. 
The Fury is one of the strongest teams in the Continental Basketball 
Association, but the crowd had not gathered to watch it run through its plays -- 
they were there to see the Fury's newest and already most popular player, the 
platinum-selling rap artist Master P. 

''We usually have eight or nine kids hanging around the top of the gym watching 
practice,'' said Rob Brown, media relations director for the Fury. ''When P showed 
up for his first practice, word started to get around that he was there. Some 
people called their friends. Others left and went to get friends, and by the end 
of practice there were 200 people surrounding the gym shooting videos and taking 
pictures. It was incredible.'' 

What Percy Miller, known to legions of rap fans as Master P, is attempting to do 
is incredible. In five years, he has made the record label he owns, No Limit, 
not just the biggest rap label in the country, but also the biggest independent 
label. By reviving mostly Southern-style gangsta rap, and smartly creating buzz 
on the street, No Limit has sold an estimated $200 million in records this year 
alone. 

Also his label's most successful rapper, Miller entered the pop charts at No. 1 
in June with his most recent album, ''M. P. Da Last Don.'' At the time, Miller 
announced that he was going to retire as a rapper (a rarity for any pop musician 
at the top of his or her game) so he could concentrate on being an executive. 

But last month, he set his sights on another prize: basketball. A former high 
school star in New Orleans, Miller, a 6-foot-3-inch, 195-pound point guard, is 
trying to make it in the C.B.A., one step below the National Basketball 
Association, with dreams of eventually landing a spot in the N.B.A. While a 
number of N.B.A. players and other athletes have attempted to cross over into 
the entertainment world -- and some, most notably Shaquille O'Neal, have been 
successful -- spokesmen for the N.B.A., the Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers 
said they could not remember a rap or pop star ever trying to make it into the 
league. 

In addition to playing ball, Miller is fast becoming a significant sports 
businessman. Last year, he started No Limit Sports Management, which represents 
four N.B.A. players, including two of 1997's most promising draft picks, the 
Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard Derek Anderson (a devoted Master P fan, who 
had the rapper's slogan ''No Limit Soldier'' tattooed on his arm four years ago) 
and the Boston Celtics swingman Ron Mercer, whom Miller wooed away from David 
Falk, the most powerful basketball agent in the business. Both players plan to 
live with Miller at his No Limit compound in Baton Rouge, La., where a 
multimillion-dollar dormitory is under construction for the rappers and athletes 
he works with. 
  
Long-Range View, Nifty Connections 


''What I offer my players is that I show them how to start up their own 
businesses and how to prepare themselves for the future,'' said Miller, who is 
not an agent himself but whose company employs several licensed sports agents. 
''I tell them that basketball is going to end someday and that they have to 
prepare themselves for a future outside of basketball. They know I know what I'm 
talking about because that's what happened to me. 

''I wasn't always selling a million records. I started out selling 1,000 and 500. 
They know about my success in business and they know that I can market them: I 
can put them in movies, I can put them in videos, I can have them endorse 
clothing lines, I can help them make good investments. By being in the 
entertainment business, I have connections that other agents don't.'' 

Other agents, including Falk, have been able to put a number of N.B.A. athletes 
into movies and videos. What lured Mercer, along with Miller's connections, was 
Miller's ability to relate to young athletes and the camaraderie he felt at No 
Limit. 

''I could talk to P about everything from basketball to business,'' said Mercer, 
who appeared in a No Limit music video this summer. ''Once I sat down and saw 
that everybody at No Limit was real and straight up, I signed with them. There 
was a real family atmosphere there. I can't say that about other agents.'' 

Known as a masterful negotiator and street-smart businessman, Miller has also 
invested in real estate, a Foot Locker franchise and a gas station in addition 
to starting a No Limit clothing line, a phone sex service and a film division 
that has produced several best-selling straight-to-video movies starring Miller. 


In September, on its list of the country's highest-paid entertainers, Forbes 
magazine placed Miller at No. 10 -- behind Jerry Seinfeld, Steven Spielberg and 
the Rolling Stones but ahead of Celine Dion, Puff Daddy and the Spice Girls. 

Speaking from a plush three-bedroom executive suite on the top floor of the Fort 
Wayne Hilton (the 17 other players trying out for the team stayed at a Best 
Western), Miller said that his dream was always to play basketball, not to make 
records. Rapping, he said, was just something he was good at and a ticket out of 
the ghetto. But, with no professional or major college experience, years of 
nonphysical work as a rapper and executive, and a training history that goes 
back to only the beginning of this summer, is it realistic to think that he 
could play in the N.B.A.? 

Those who know Master P as a businessman said they had little doubt that he 
would accomplish whatever he set his mind to. 

''When he sat down two weeks ago and told me he was going to play in the N.B.A., 
I was skeptical,'' said Bryan Turner, the president of Priority Records, which 
distributes Master P's No Limit label. ''But then he put in a tape of him playing 
with all these N.B.A. players for charity in Houston, and I couldn't even tell 
it was him. He held his own. Then I flashed back to five years ago when he came 
to me and said he was going to sell millions of records. He believes anything 
can be accomplished, and he's proven it. He's definitely going to make it.'' 
  
Holding His Own, At Least on Offense 


Miller and his younger brother, the 6-7 Vyshonn (rap name: Silkk the Shocker), 
were the only non-N.B.A. players to compete three weeks ago in that charity game 
at the University of Houston. On the court with N.B.A. players like Stephon 
Marbury, Nick Van Exel, Rasheed Wallace and Anfernee Hardaway, Percy Miller 
scored 22 points. 

While he displayed solid ballhandling skills and court vision, Miller's success 
must be kept in perspective -- the players, wary of injuring themselves, played 
little defense. Keith Smart, the Fort Wayne Fury's head coach, who played 
professionally in the N.B.A., the C.B.A. and Europe, said Miller has good skills 
but is not near the N.B.A. level yet. 

''He's a born leader,'' Smart said. ''He can handle the ball and he pushes the ball 
really well on the fast break. But it's going to take some coaching to smooth 
out the rough edges. He's been playing street ball, pickup ball, where there's 
no defense. Now, he has to learn how to deal with officials, how to read 
different defensive schemes, and how to run an offense while someone's putting 
pressure on you. Those are things you would normally get by playing with a coach 
every day, but he lacks them right now.'' 

What impressed Smart the most was that Miller arrived at training camp in 
''basketball shape.'' 

Miller said: ''Most people probably think that since I'm a rapper, I'm hanging 
out at the bar room and smoking weed all night. But that ain't Master P. If I 
was in the league and they had a drug test right now, I would pass because I 
don't do drugs. I'm an athlete. I keep myself in shape.'' 

Miller's basketball background is unclear. He played at Booker T. Washington and 
Warren Easton High Schools in New Orleans; he said he graduated from Warren 
Easton in 1987 and received a full basketball scholarship to the University of 
Houston, where he injured his knee during preseason practice and subsequently 
left the school after he refused to be red-shirted. 

While Rick Poulter, the sports information director at the University of 
Houston, said Percy Miller is not mentioned in any of the school's basketball 
media guides, he did find a team questionnaire that was apparently filled out by 
Miller in 1985. The questionnaire, which Poulter said proves that Miller was on 
the team for at least two weeks, lists him as being a 6-4, 178-pound freshman 
who averaged 18 points, 9 assists, 5 rebounds and 3 steals for Warren Easton. 
Poulter said Miller was probably a walk-on, but did not rule out the possibility 
of his having been on scholarship. 

The questionnaire also says Miller graduated from Easton in 1985 and was born in 
April 1968, which would make him 30 today. But Miller, who maintained that he 
did not fill out the questionnaire, said he was born in 1970 and is 28. 

Of the 18 players currently scrimmaging with the Fury, the team will keep 10 in 
addition to one developmental player. The roster must be set by Wednesday, and 
the first game is Friday against the Connecticut Pride in Hartford. 

The average salary in the C.B.A. is $1,500 a week. Miller signed a nonguaranteed 
contract for $1,000 a week. 
  
Publicity Angle Seems a Factor 


Though Smart only implied that P was going to make the team, Jay Leonard, one of 
the Fury's majority owners, said it was a certainty. 

''After that first week, we really felt like he was going to make the team,'' 
Leonard said. ''He can help us as far as publicity, which we're getting right 
now. We've got CNN and ESPN coming in next week. It's good for us because a lot 
of people don't know what the C.B.A.'s all about and how good these guys really 
are.'' 

For Miller to earn significant playing time, however, may be difficult. The Fury 
has two of the best point guards in the league: Damon Bailey and Moochie Norris, 
both former second-round draft picks in the N.B.A. 

Though the popular rhythm-and-blues singer and songwriter R. Kelly played a few 
games for the Atlantic City Seagulls in the less competitive United States 
Basketball League, and Mark Miller, the lead singer in the country group Sawyer 
Brown, worked out once with the Fury, neither had the talent or the commitment 
that Master P has displayed. The Fury players said that at first they were 
skeptical about the rapper's abilities, but that he quickly proved himself as a 
player and teammate. 

''Obviously you don't think of a rapper as being a great player or even a good 
player, but he belongs here,'' Bailey said. ''He's a good player. You could tell 
that the first day he was here, and he's getting better. Whether or not he makes 
the team, I don't know. But if he does make the team, nobody can say that it's a 
gimmick because he's talented enough to play in this league.'' 

Like everybody else on the team, Miller waits in line after practice for the 
standard $15 per diem players receive during training camp. The other players 
sometimes tease the multiplatinum rapper about taking the money, but he 
responds, ''Man, I ain't letting nothing get by me.'' 

But not everyone is taking Miller's attempt to play basketball lightly. Some 
skeptics in the music business wonder whether the time it will take to play in 
the C.B.A. and train for the N.B.A. will distract him from his very hands-on 
duties running his record label No Limit. 

However, Bryan Turner at Priority said he was not worried. ''P said: 'Bryan, 
think of the marketing possibilities. Everyone's going to have to buy our 
records now.' And then we both started laughing.''
