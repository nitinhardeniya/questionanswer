For the first time since 1951 there will be no National Basketball Association 
All-Star Game. It's Day 162 of the lockout. No new bargaining talks are 
scheduled. Do you think the season is in peril? 

Canceling the All-Star Game, the league's signature regular-season event, had 
been expected for a week, but Commissioner David Stern's announcement yesterday 
revealed the dire straits the season is in. ''This is just a result of the 
inexorable march of the calendar,'' Stern said. ''There just isn't enough time 
left to have a season and an All-Star Game.'' 

The game had been scheduled Feb. 14 in Philadelphia. 

Stern spoke to Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell yesterday morning, and 
promised that Philadelphia would be awarded the game in 2002. The Golden State 
Warriors will host next season's game, and the 2001 game is likely to go to 
Washington. 

Philadelphia officials estimated that the city and its business will lose out on 
about $40 million. Eighteen hotels, which had set aside more than 5,000 rooms 
for the league, had expected to make more than $6 million. Two weeks ago, Jam 
Session, a four-day event of displays and interactive events, was canceled, and 
it had been expected to draw as many as 100,000 people to the Philadelphia 
Convention Center. 

Beyond the financial impact, Philadelphia was primed for its return to 
professional basketball prominence for perhaps the first time since Julius 
Erving and Moses Malone led the 76ers to the championship in 1983. 

''We look at this as a deal for us to promote the league, but it's not a money 
maker of us,'' said a league official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 

Stern said, ''If we and our players, who are ultimately going to have to work 
together to rebuild this sport, can't make this deal, I don't think there is 
that much hope for the sport itself.'' 

The cancellation will mean a substantial loss in advertising revenue for NBC and 
Turner Sports. Last year the game drew a 10.6 rating, meaning more than 10 
million households were tuned into the game at Madison Square Garden. Only the 
Christmas Day game draws a similar regular-season rating. 

Turner Sports drew a 2.7 rating for its All-Star Saturday show last season, a 
rating 1 point higher than its regular season average of 1.7. 

''Like all other N.B.A. fans, we are disappointed by the cancellation of the 
All-Star Game,'' said Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports. ''But we continue to 
be hopeful that an agreement can be reached and the season will resume next 
month.'' 

The league's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, said: ''Clearly, the largest 
financial toll will be on the networks. It's the biggest regular season event 
for NBC and Turner.'' 

Both networks have clauses in their contracts with the N.B.A. to recoup the 
losses through added games or reduced rights fees in subsequent seasons. 

Billy Hunter, the union executive director, said in a prepared statement: 
''Sadly, the owners have elected to cheat millions of fans and the city of 
Philadelphia out of a wonderful spectacle. Unfortunately for the owners, their 
effort to further intimidate the players will not succeed. We have already 
offered unprecedented concessions and are willing to negotiate even further but 
we will only accept a deal that is fair to both sides. 

''The owners should either come to the table now and negotiate in good faith to 
end the lockout or take us up on our offer to bring in a mediator who will 
examine the issues from a neutral perspective and help settle the differences. 
There is still enough time to limit the damage caused to our sport but only if 
the owners turn constructive rather than destructive.'' 

Hunter said last week that Jan. 1 would be the date when a deal must be imminent 
to salvage the season. 

Granik responded: ''He might be right. I don't know.'' 

The N.B.A. canceled its All-Star Game four years to the day after the National 
Hockey League dispensed with its All-Star Game during a labor dispute. That work 
stoppage ended on Jan. 25, 1995, 12 days after an agreement was reached. 

Pointing out that the National Hockey League had held a training camp and filled 
out its rosters with free agents before a lockout was imposed, Stern rejected 
the obvious parallel and repeated that about a month would be needed to restart 
any basketball season. 

As to what kind of season that might be, Granik said the league would be willing 
to extend the playoffs until the end of June, which is about 10 days later than 
usual, but not July. 

''The households using television drops off so dramatically as you approach July 
4 weekend that I don't think that's a realistic possibility,'' he said. 

What is more, if there is a season, the younger, running teams may reap 
immediate benefits. Teams may be required to play three nights in a row. Also, 
cross-country travel will be significantly cut down. 

''I would expect, that whatever number of games is agreed upon, you're going to 
see a conference-type schedule with perhaps some mix of interconference games,'' 
Granik said. ''But not every team is going to see every other team at home.''
