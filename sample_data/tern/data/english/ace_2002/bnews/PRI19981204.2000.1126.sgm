Finally, a radical break with the past could be in the cards for
Venezuelans who elect a new president on Sunday. The front runner is a
former Army colonel, Hugo Chavez, who six years ago, admitted to the
country that he and 3,000 rebel troops tried and failed to overthrow the
government. But what Chavez couldn't do with guns and tanks then, he may be
about to do at the ballot box. Opinion polls show Chavez 12 points ahead of
his nearest rival. The former military man's charisma is winning him plenty
of support in a country where the good times have gone. Falling oil
revenues have forced governments to push through austerity programs, even a
former Miss Universe beauty queen, attractive though she is, is failing to
attract much support.
