The Pentagon says it was "distressed" a U.S. serviceman scrawled the words
"Happy Ramadan" on a missile before it was fired at Iraq last week.
Officials call the incident inappropriate saying it doesn't reflect
american policy or values.
But Pentagon spokesman Ken bacon did not say there would be an
investigation.
The incident came to light after a wire service photographer took a picture
of the missile.
