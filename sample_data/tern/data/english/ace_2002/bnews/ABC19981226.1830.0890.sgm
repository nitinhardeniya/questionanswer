<TEXT>
President Clinton is calling for a crackdown on drunk drivers.
In his weekly radio address today, he urged adoption of a national blood
alcohol limit, 0.08%.
This year I worked with members of Congress to make 0.08 the law of the
land.
Tragically the special interests blocked this life saving measure.
I am determined to succeed in setting a 0.08 standard in the new year.
<TURN>
Most states aren't as tough and have a higher legal limit than that.
