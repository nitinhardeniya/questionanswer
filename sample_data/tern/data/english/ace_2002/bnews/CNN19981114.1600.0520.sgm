This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather update."
Two areas of low pressure will move across the eastern U.S. as we head
through Sunday.
In the west, a cold front moving into the Rockies will mean showers and
some high-elevation snows.
A new cold front system is due in from the west, and it looks like cloudy
skies and rain stay in your pacific forecast for the early part of the
workweek.
A low pressure system should be weakening in the gulf of Mexico, but rain
is still on tap for most of the deep south.
Temperatures will be in the 60s, 70s and 80s across the southern tier of
states, with 30s, 40s and 50s to the north.
On the extended forecast picture -- look for heavy rainfall in the
northwest, a mix of rain and snow for the northern Rockies and the northern
plains, and a heavy mix across the Great Lakes on Monday.
Thunderstorms could be possible across Florida ending by Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall, though, remains in your pacific northwest forecast for
tuesday, gradually tapering off as we head into Wednesday.
Some snow and showers can be expected for the northern plains into lake
superior.
The extended forecast for more than 7,000 cities is at CNN.com.
