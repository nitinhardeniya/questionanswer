There is no shortage of places and people willing and able to help a family
in trouble, a family trying to stop the violence.
In Boston, Betsy McAlister Grove runs the child witness to violence project
at the Boston medical center.
<TIMEX2 val="1998-10-20TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tonight</TIMEX2>, she offers some guidance for families, "in her own words."

I think frequently the way we think about it is to say, "yes, we know the
bad news, and the bad news is that many children are profoundly affected by
growing up in homes where there's domestic violence."
But the good news, I think, is that we also know something about how to
help these children, and the first step is in really identifying these
children and in helping them, giving them a place to go, someone to talk to
about it.
We hear stories from children about seeing their mothers being threatened,
seeing them being hit or attacked.
One way to begin to break the chain is to intervene early in children's
lives, to try to reach them when they're young so that they don't have <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">year
after year after year</TIMEX2> of growing up with violence to try to reach them soon
after they've witnessed a violent event.
The best way, often, to help children is to help their mothers get to
safety.
And if we can help families achieve safety, we've done an important piece
of work.
