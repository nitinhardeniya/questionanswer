WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. senators on the Governmental Affairs Committee heard 
some eye-opening testimony <TIMEX2 val="1996-05-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> from a man who says he worked with 
members of the Russian mob. He claims the Russian mob is going international 
with the help of the Italian Mafia, and is using the United States as a base 
of operations.
"It was not unusual for me to receive nine million dollars in cash <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">per week</TIMEX2> in 
paper bags from the Russians," <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-05-16" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">ex</TIMEX2>-Mafia capo Michael Franzese told senators. 
He said the Russian mob came up with a scheme to cheat on gasoline taxes, and 
made a deal for Mafia help.
  
"I would provide them with protection from the other mob families, and the 
muscle to collect all the money due them."
A <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-05-16" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Mafia underboss, testifying behind a screen, confessed he ordered the 
murder of a Russian competitor outside Brooklyn's Odessa <TIMEX2 val="TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">night</TIMEX2> club to protect 
their racket.
"We couldn't let somebody try to put the squeeze on our family's biggest money 
maker," Anthony "Gas Pipe" Casso testified.
Officials from the Drug Enforcement Agency told a Senate hearing on Russian 
crime <TIMEX2 val="1996-05-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> the two mobs are <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-05-16" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> moving into drug deals together, with 
Russian gangsters smuggling heroin into the United States for Italian 
mobsters.
A Russian criminal whose identity was kept secret said that drugs are also 
moving in the other direction -- cocaine is going to Russia from the United 
States.
  
"These men have beautiful offices in Rockefeller Center and Beverly Hills, and 
look like legitimate businessmen," the Russian told the Senate. He also said 
that Soviet-born hockey stars in the National Hockey League, including 
Alexander Mogilny, have been targets of unsuccessful shakedown attempts by 
Russian gangsters. He said Mogilny went to the police, who caught the man 
threatening him, Sergei Fomichev.
Vladimir Malakhov of the Montreal Canadiens was also threatened, he said, when 
he was with the New York Islanders. When he went to Montreal "the problem" 
went away, the witness said.
Also among those who refused to pay: defenseman Alexei Zhitnik, <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-05-16" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="during Russian mafia career at unspecified time in the past.">then</TIMEX2> with the 
Los Angeles Kings. Zhitnik did not go to the police, the crook said. Instead, 
he went to a more powerful criminal group who took care of the shakedown for 
him.
United States law enforcement officials say the Russian mob is still largely 
disorganized, but this may be changing, as the mob grows more powerful and 
ambitious. Sources say the Russians are <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-05-16" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> trying to carve deals with 
Colombia's top cocaine cartel, as well as the Italian Mafia, for a global 
partnership in drugs and crime.
