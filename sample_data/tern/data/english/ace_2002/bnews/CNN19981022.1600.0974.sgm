The Dow industrials managed to make it seven winning sessions in a row, the
longest winning streak in 16 months.
The gain came despite disappointing earnings reports from 3m and shev Ron.
The Dow ending the day up at 8533.
It had been down 96 points.
The broader market higher.
The NASDAQ posting healthy 27 point gain.
