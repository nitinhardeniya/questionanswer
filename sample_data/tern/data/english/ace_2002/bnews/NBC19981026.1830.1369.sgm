<TURN>
Some people say that you may have earned as high as $4 million so far.
Is that possible?
<TURN>
That could be very possible.
I don't know.
Nobody ever told me.
<TURN>
From the time you were 14 and you started really earning money, did you
ever see checks?
Did you ever know how much money you would be making for an appearance?
<TURN>
no.
When I was young, I had no clue.
I didn't even know they were paid a lot of times.
Nobody would tell me.
I didn't know about the money.
I didn't care.
I did it because I loved to win, and that was that.
