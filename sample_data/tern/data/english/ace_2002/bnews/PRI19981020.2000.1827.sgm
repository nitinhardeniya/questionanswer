For THE WORLD, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London. King
Hussein of Jordan has joined President Clinton and Israeli and Palestinian
leaders at the peace talks in Maryland which are in their sixth day. The
king has been in close touch with talks from the Minnesota clinic where
he's being treated for cancer. U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
said the U.S. has invited the king to help persuade the two sides to make
the tough choices for peace.

Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday, clearly we're into a phase
of very hard bargaining. A lot of the under brush has been cleared away,
and it's a part of the end game that is getting more and more serious.
