Janet Reno must decide by tomorrow whether to launch another independent
counsel investigation of the Clinton White House.
It would focus on former deputy White House chief of staff Harold Ickes.
At issue -- whether he lied to a Senate committee about whether the Clinton
administration tried to intervene in a teamsters union dispute with a
Company called diamond walnut.
By next week, Reno must also make a decision on a possible independent
counsel investigation of President Clinton concerning some democratic
national committee campaign commercials.
