Tonight, our "in depth" special report -- Saddam, dangerous game.
Saddam Hussein still appears to have the upper hand against America and its
allies.
Since the end of the war, some 250 teams of United Nations weapons
inspectors 40 countries have spent at least $30 million each year,
searching and disarming Saddam's weapons of mass destruction.
But at each step, Saddam has thwarted those inspectors.
In fact, thrown them out of the country, and that leaves the Iraqi dictator
free to pursue his dangerous game.
We begin tonight's "in depth" special report with NBC's Andrea Mitchell.

Khidhir hamza, the man Saddam Hussein chose to make his nuclear
bomb, now the highest-ranking scientist ever to defect from Iraq.
Spirited out by the CIA in 1994, today, for the first time, telling his
story on television.
How did Saddam Hussein hide his nuclear weapons?
<TURN>
Many of them were put in houses and schools and other buildings.
Some were kept on trucks.
Some were put on railroad as railroad cargo and kept on railroads moving
back and forth.

Hiding them from UN inspectors, a deadly cat and mouse game that
has gone on for seven years.
But now, critics say Saddam is winning the game, ignoring repeated U.S.
threats.
<TURN>
Let there be no doubt, we are prepared to act.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
And despite Iraq's recent promise to UN secretary general Kofi
Annan, Saddam has totally blocked the most critical UN inspections.
With no one looking, U.S. intelligence officials believe he could rebuild
his chemical and biological weapons, even make an atomic bomb within
months.
<TURN>
If Saddam gets the bomb, he'll be a hero in the Arab world and the Islamic
world.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
After spending tens of billions of dollars to defeat and contain
him, how could Saddam again be such a threat?
The real question?
Why has the U.S. abandoned its hard-line on Iraq and turned the problem
over to the UN?
<TURN>
There are certain critics who would have us rush to use force.
But in our view, the responsible course is to pursue all the diplomatic
alternatives.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Former President George bush -- isn't there the appearance that
the U.S. has backed down?
<TURN>
The U.S. must not back down.
The U.S. must mobilize world opinion and get the international community
behind us with the most forceful diplomatic initiative we can bring to
bear.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
For Bill Clinton a policy shift that raises big questions about
credibility.
<TURN>
I believe the course on which we are on now is extremely dangerous, because
it devalues our threats.
We're talking about sanctions, but we're not enforcing them.
And it undermines our plans and it may embolden our enemies.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Despite an apparent flip-flop, the administration says the
military option has not been ruled out.
But America's allies are tired of the endless standoff with Iraq and not
sure the U.S. will ever follow through.
<TURN>
If you indicated you were going to use force and then the private diplomacy
failed, the diplomacy failed or the international sanctions failed, you
better be prepared to use it.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
So has Saddam Hussein won?
<TURN>
So far, yes.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
And Saddam Hussein is still taunting the U.S. and defying the
world.
