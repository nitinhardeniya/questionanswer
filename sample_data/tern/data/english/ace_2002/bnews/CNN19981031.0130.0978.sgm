Saturn is ending production of its two-door cars and introducing the
industry's first three-door coupe.
A company spokesman says lower gas prices and demand for roomier vehicles
have caused small car sales to slip.
So Saturn is putting a small driver-side door on its sc-1 and sc-2 models.
The company unveiled the new car Friday in Boston.
Martin of the company says the motto will be, "why didn't anybody think of
this before?"
