In Miami <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>, the U.S. customs service has been patting itself on the
back for recovering a stolen Moon rock.
In <TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="event-anchored duration">the 30 years since Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon</TIMEX2>, that's never

The "Apollo" astronauts went 250,000 miles to collect Moon rocks,
and ever --
<TURN>
Nobody owns a piece of the Moon.
We all own it.

Sealed in plastic which they said a Florida man kept in his safe
deposit box and tried to sell to undercover agents for $5 million.
<TURN>
We're taking a piece of the rock itself.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
The rock from the Apollo 17 flight had been given to a gift to
honduras.
It was allegedly smuggled back here.
<TURN>
We started this investigation thinking we were going to get bogus lunar
material.
We really didn't expect to come up with a real one.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Almost 100 samples have been presented to forge governments for
good will and the U.S. cannot tell if some of them have reached the black
market.
There have been no charges yet.
It turns out there are no laws against owning a Moon rock, but there are
plenty against smuggling one through customs.
