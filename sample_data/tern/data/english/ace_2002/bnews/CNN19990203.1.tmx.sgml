JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: In Russia, new indications of just of how influential 
organized crime has become. 

CNN's Steve Harrigan reports on one of the latest Mafia take- overs. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

STEVE HARRIGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A Siberian cemetery that used to 
be reserved for war heroes is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-02-03T18:08-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> making room for a new kind of fighter. 

MIKHAIL VIERB, TOUR GUIDE: Here you see one of the leaders with his driver and 
his bodyguards. 

HARRIGAN: Sacred turf has been taken over by the Russian Mafia. Mikhial 
Kutchin's (ph) widow paid $75,000 for a mausoleum made of malachite, complete 
with the keys to a Mercedes. 

VALERY INCZEMTSEV, YEKATERINBURG POLICE (through translator): They are monsters 
who covered the whole region, the whole country with dead bodies. 

HARRIGAN: They gave their lives in a real war, the battle to control the wealth 
of minerals from the Ural mountains. Mortal enemies in life, more than 30 
members of the rival Uralmash (ph) and Central (ph) gangs <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-02-03T18:08-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> lie side by side 
in the Yekaterinburg cemetery. Most of the victims are under 35. Gang leaders 
get full-scale reproductions, the soldiers get a bust. Even the tour guide says 
he's disgusted. 

VIERB: And this is a challenge to the public to demonstrate the influence and 
the impudence of the criminal and semi-criminal groups in the society. 

HARRIGAN: The sneer of cold command lingers on after death. 

(on camera): And For some, the violence doesn't even end here. This bronze head 
of a man who was blown up by a car bomb, <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-02-03T18:08-05" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2> had to be replaced, because it 
was blown up, too. 

Steve Harrigan, CNN, Yekaterinburg, Russia.
