U.S. and British aircraft flew patrols over northern and southern Iraq
without incident Thursday, as Iraq vowed to keep on challenging the western
action. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said there will be no let up
in what he called Iraq's battle against aggressors. Iraqi air defense has
fired on allied patrols enforcing the no-fly zones twice this week drawing
retaliation from U.S. war planes.
