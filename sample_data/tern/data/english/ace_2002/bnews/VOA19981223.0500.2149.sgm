And Israel says its upcoming early elections will not delay implementation
of the Y River peace agreement provided Palestinians uphold their end of
the Accord. Both the Palestinian authority and the Untied States had
reacted sharply to reports that the peace process would be frozen during
the election campaign which could extend into May. But, an Israeli
government spokesman said, Tuesday, Israel will carry out its commitments
under the Y Accord regardless of the election, as long as the Palestinians
do the same.
