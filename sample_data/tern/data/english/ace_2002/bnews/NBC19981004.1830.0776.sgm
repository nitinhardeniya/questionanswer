In New York tonight, baseball star Darryl Strawberry is in stable
condition, recovering from successful cancer surgery yesterday.
Doctors are hoping his celebrity status will make him a role model for
early detection.
Here's NBC's Rick Davis.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
The New York Yankees got the word that Darryl Strawberry is alert
and feeling strong during their workout today.
But his bout with colon cancer seems to have delivered a message to some of
the Yankees.
<TURN>
I'm sure that with the awareness, people are going to seek it out and get
tested and do that when they get their physicals.
I'm sure.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
And the message may carry beyond the playing fields.
<TURN>
Someone of his national presence will certainly awaken the American
population that this is not only a disease of older individuals but
certainly someone as healthy and young as Darryl.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Initial reports are optimistic, but it may be a week before
doctors at this New York hospital know if the cancer has spread to the
lymph nodes and if Strawberry will need chemotherapy.
But there are models for recovery.
Eric Davis just had his best year in baseball.
He had colon surgery in 1997.
Brett Butler was back on the diamond four months after throat surgery for
cancer.
Can Strawberry come back?
<TURN>
Typically, someone like this is going to recover very well from surgery.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
And Strawberry will be hearing hopes for his return when Yankee
players visit him tonight.
<TURN>
We are just going to show our support.
It's like a family member.
We are just going to go and see how he is doing.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
And for the rest of the season, the Yankees will be wearing
Strawberry's number 39 stitched to their caps.
Rick Davis, NBC news, New York.
