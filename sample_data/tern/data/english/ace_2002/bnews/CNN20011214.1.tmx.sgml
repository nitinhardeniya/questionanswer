WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush said <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> the United States has
notified Russia that it intends to pull out of the <TIMEX2 val="1972" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1972</TIMEX2> Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, starting a <TIMEX2 val="P6M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-12" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">six-month</TIMEX2> timetable for withdrawal and
opening the way for the creation of an anti-missile defense system.

"<TIMEX2 val="2001-12-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Today</TIMEX2> I am giving formal notice to Russia that the United States of
America is withdrawing from this <TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1972" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">almost 30-year-old</TIMEX2> treaty," Bush said
in the White House Rose Garden. "I have concluded the ABM treaty
hinders our government's ability to develop ways to protect our people
from future terrorist or rogue state missile attacks."

The announcement came after <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="not clear when this period of months ended">months of talks in which U.S. officials
hoped to persuade Russia to set the treaty aside and negotiate a new
strategic agreement</TIMEX2>. But a breakthrough did not materialize, and Bush
decided to go ahead with a unilateral withdrawal.

Bush said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin "have also agreed
that my decision to withdraw from the treaty will not in any way
undermine our new relationship or Russian security."
  
The President of the United States has executive authority to
negotiate or withdraw the United States from treaties without seeking
congressional approval. The Senate has authority only to ratify
treaties.

In response to the White House announcement, Putin said both countries
should move quickly to create a "new framework of our strategic
relationship." But he called Bush's decision to abandon the treaty a
"mistake."

Yet Putin, who went on national television in Russia to address the
nation, said the U.S. move "presents no threat to the security of the
Russian Federation."

The ABM pact, negotiated with the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-12-14" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Soviet Union during the Cold
War, specifically forbids testing and deployment of a ballistic
missile defense system. Bush believes such a system is critical for
U.S. defense in <TIMEX2 val="20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 21st century</TIMEX2>, and for <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-12" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">months</TIMEX2> he has advocated
scrapping the ABM treaty, calling it a relic from <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="pragmatically, past ref">a much different
time</TIMEX2>, a theme he repeated on <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>.

"The <TIMEX2 val="1972" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1972</TIMEX2> ABM treaty was signed by the United States and the Soviet
Union at <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a much different time</TIMEX2>, in a vastly different world," he
said. "One of the signatories, the Soviet Union, no longer exists and
neither does the hostility that once led both our countries to keep
thousands of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert, pointed at each
other."

<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-12-13" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Today</TIMEX2>, he said, both nations face different enemies. "<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-12-13" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Today</TIMEX2>, as the
events of <TIMEX2 val="2001-09-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September 11</TIMEX2> made all too clear, the greatest threats to
both our countries come not from each other, or from other big powers
in the world, but from terrorists who strike without warning or rogue
states who seek weapons of mass destruction," Bush said.

Some question consequences

Arms control advocates have argued against abrogating the ABM treaty,
saying amendments to allow the defense system tests should be
negotiated with Moscow and the treaty left in place.

Congressional Democrats greeted the news with skepticism. Some called
Bush's plan a misguided and poorly timed decision.

"We don't know what effect this will have yet. We do know that it
poses some serious questions regarding our relationship with our
allies, with Russia and with China, that we're going to have to
consider very, very carefully," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-South Dakota, said <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>.

Daschle said he was concerned withdrawal from the ABM treaty could
"rupture relations with key countries around the world," and raises
serious questions about <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-12-13" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">future</TIMEX2> arms races involving other countries.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Delaware,
admonished the White House on the Senate floor after Bush informed
congressional leaders of his plans on <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>. Biden said the move
would cause an arms buildup not just in Russia but also in Pakistan
and India, increasing tensions in southern Asia.

Biden later called Bush's priorities "out of whack." He said America
should be more worried about terrorists with weapons of mass
destruction than countries with long-range ballistic missiles.

"<TIMEX2 val="2001-09-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September 11</TIMEX2> indicated our country is vulnerable," Biden said. "The
thing we remain the least vulnerable to is an ICBM attack from another
nation."

Bush cites terrorism threat

The administration's position is just the opposite: The <TIMEX2 val="2001-09-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September 11</TIMEX2>
attacks demonstrate that if rogue nations which support terrorists
develop long-range missiles, they would undoubtedly use them.

"We know that the terrorists and some of those who support them seek
the ability to deliver death and destruction to our doorstep via
missile," Bush said <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>. "And we must have the freedom and the
flexibility to develop effective defenses against those attacks."

Still, some Democrats questioned the urgency to pull out, saying the
missile defense system could have been tested without breaching the
ABM treaty. Daschle said pulling out was "a high price to pay for
testing that was not required this early in the schedule for missile
defenses."

But White House officials said missile defense testing would soon
"bump" into the ABM treaty, and the president felt it was best to
proceed with withdrawal.

"All along, the United States has been concerned with the fact that
the timetable to develop a test to protect the country on missile
defense was bumping into the ABM Treaty. The bump was about to take
place," said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.

Therefore, he said, "the president's judgment was that the most
productive way to proceed to maintain good relations would be to
proceed with clarity. And that clarity is to move beyond the treaty so
that the United States will not be inhibited in any way of developing
a robust testing system."

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the treaty is outdated and
"does not reflect the strategic realities of <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-12-13" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">today</TIMEX2>."

"It did not and does not protect the American people from attack. It
failed to recognize that the Soviet Union is gone and that Russia is,
of course, not our enemy," he said.

Rumsfeld said he plans to meet with the Russian defense minister <TIMEX2 val="2001-W51" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next
week</TIMEX2> in Brussels to continue discussions on what framework should
replace the longstanding treaty. Rumsfeld and other administration
officials noted that Russia and the U.S. have agreed to reduce
offensive strategic nuclear weapons, and relations between the two
countries are good.

In Moscow on <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, Putin, for the first time publicly offered
specifics in response to Bush's plan to reduce the U.S. nuclear
arsenal.  Putin said the reduction should be 1,500 to 2,200 warheads,
a figure slightly lower than the one proposed by Bush, who set it at
1,700 to 2,200.

Administration seeks to quell concerns

"We still have exactly the same attitude and approach that the
president and President Putin announced, and that is that we are
looking forward, we're not looking back. That we do not consider them
an enemy. And that the basis that we want to go forward is to find
ways that we can deal with transparency and predictability with
respect to the behavior of each country on offensive and defensive
nuclear weapons," Rumsfeld said. "And we intend to do that."

Fleischer noted that Bush also consulted by telephone with the leaders
of China, Britain, France, Germany and Japan. He added that leaders of
other countries, including Spain, Italy, Hungary and Poland have
expressed support for the move.

China's President Jiang Zemin, who has expressed perhaps the greatest
concern over the U.S. withdrawal, told Bush he "looked forward to
further high-level dialogue on the topic," Fleischer said.

The Chinese, who have a much smaller nuclear arsenal than Russia, are
concerned that the U.S. national missile defense plan could be used to
block their missiles, thereby upsetting the nuclear balance of power.
Critics have said the move could push China to add more nuclear
weapons to its stockpile, reigniting the arms race.

But Bush sought to assure Jiang when they met in Shanghai <TIMEX2 val="2001-FA" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this fall</TIMEX2>
that development of a national missile defense "is not a threat to
China," Fleischer said. "China, which can launch many [missiles],
could not be stopped."

Jiang, traveling <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> in Myanmar on an official visit, said the
Chinese position remains: Beijing is opposed to the U.S. missile
defense program and the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM treaty. Jiang
said there's a need for multilateral efforts to ensure world peace,
according to Chinese media.  Bush administration officials have made
efforts to ease worries in other nations as well. During stops <TIMEX2 val="2001-W50" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
week</TIMEX2> in Berlin, London and Paris, Powell tried to quell European
concerns about the consequences of scrapping the treaty,
U.S. officials said.

"I don't see the basis for an arms race in anything that we have
done," Powell said <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>. "I see a basis for increased strategic
stability, and I look forward to working with my Russian colleagues,
as does Secretary Rumsfeld, in pursuing that."

Bush said he looks forward to visiting Moscow <TIMEX2 val="2002" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2> to continue
working with Putin to develop a new strategic relationship that will
"last long beyond our individual administrations, providing a
foundation for peace for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">years to come</TIMEX2>."

"The Cold War is long gone," he said. "<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2001-12-13" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Today</TIMEX2> we leave behind one of
its last vestiges. But <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this</TIMEX2> is not <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day for looking back</TIMEX2>. <TIMEX2 val="2001-12-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">This</TIMEX2> is <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a
day for looking forward with hope and anticipation of greater
prosperity and peace for Russians, for Americans and for the entire
world</TIMEX2>."
