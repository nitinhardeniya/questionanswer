A brief review of the top story, the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
will testify before the house Judiciary committee tomorrow.
There's no doubt this evening that the democrats want to make him the issue
and the republicans said late today, they want to call other witnesses,
including the president's friend and aide, Bruce Lindsey, and the
president's lawyer, Robert Bennett.
