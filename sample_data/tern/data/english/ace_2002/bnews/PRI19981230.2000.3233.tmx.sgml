They typical marketing strategy for foreign films like Ireland's "Waking
Ned Divine" is for the producers to release them first in their home
country and then to bring them here to the United States. But Fox
Searchlight, the company distributing "Waking Ned Divine," decided to do a
switch-a-roo. "Ned Divine" opened <TIMEX2 val="1998-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2> in the United States, but it
won't be until <TIMEX2 val="1999-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">March</TIMEX2> when Irish audiences get to see it, under the
shortened title of "Waking Ned."

Trailors for "Waking Ned Divine" are featured Fishermen's Blues by the
Waterboys. Unlike the movie, which hit American shores first before coming
home to Ireland, Fishermen's Blues was a hit in Ireland <TIMEX2 val="1989" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">nine years ago</TIMEX2> and
is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-30T20:53:53.81" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> getting enough exposure in the United States to perhaps climb the
charts here.
