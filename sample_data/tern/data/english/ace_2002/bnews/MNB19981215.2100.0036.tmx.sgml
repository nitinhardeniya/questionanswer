And <TIMEX2 val="TEV" non_specific="YES">good evening</TIMEX2> to you from Capitol Hill.
The president of the United States back in the states from a <TIMEX2 val="P4D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-15" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">four-day</TIMEX2> trip
to the mideast <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-15TNI" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late tonight</TIMEX2>.
He must beginning <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tomorrow</TIMEX2> em balk on an effort nothing short of saving his
job.
The vote for in the full house for impeachment may be a foregone
conclusion.
<TIMEX2 val="PT48H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-15T21" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">These next 48</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="PT72H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-15T21" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">72 hours</TIMEX2> will be crucial, perhaps the most important of
his presidency.
It is the political struggle of his life, certainly, for a man who has won
all of <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-15T21:00:36.85" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the past</TIMEX2> struggles and for a White House that is hoping its luck
holds out to prevent a trial in the U.S. Senate.
To do so, the president needs every democrat.
He has to win over 14 republican votes.
He may have to take an extraordinary action of some sort on his own.
For the latest <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-15TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2>, we begin with NBC David Bloom at the White House.
<TIMEX2 val="1998-12-15TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tonight</TIMEX2> when the president returns from Israel, he'll confront the most
dire political crisis in his life.
These are the six republicans <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-15T21:00:36.85" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">previously</TIMEX2> leaning against impeachment or
undecided who <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> said they will vote to impeach Mr. Clinton.
<TURN>
It's become apparent and clear to me that the president did commit perjury
in a civil deposition and in grand jury testimony.
Conscience and personal character.
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="1998-12-15TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tonight</TIMEX2> the New York republican who's been spearheading the effort to nsure
rather than impeach the presidt all be conceded defeat.
<TURN>
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-15T21:00:36.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Right now</TIMEX2>, unless something unexpected and totally dramatic happens in <TIMEX2 val="PT24H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-15T21" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the
next 24</TIMEX2> or <TIMEX2 val="PT48H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-15T21" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">48 hours</TIMEX2>, the president is going to be impeached.
<TURN>
But against alldds, the White House does soo a way out.
<TIMEX2 val="1998-12-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Today</TIMEX2> Michael castle of Delaware proposed the president be censured pay a
Fine of no less than $2 million and remain bject to criminal prosecution
after he leaves office.
<TIMEX2 val="1998-12-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Typo - should be Tomorrow?">Morrow</TIMEX2> Connecticut congressman Chris Shays meets with the president to ask
him on behalf of a small number of still undecided republicans to admit he
lied under oath.
<TIMEX2 val="1998-12-15TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tonight</TIMEX2> as Clinton supporters work the halls of Congress to Muster votes,
White House aides say if Shays or castle can deliver th14 republicans the
president needs, the president would consider paying a fine that could
exceed $1 million and acknowledge he made false statements under oath.
Not perjury.
But even that is an admission Mr. Clinton has so far refused to make.
Still a leading democrat advising the president says the question is
whether the president fears impeachment more than indictment.
The White House is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-15T21:00:36.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> gearing up for the next big battle, a likely Senate
trial they never thought would come.
