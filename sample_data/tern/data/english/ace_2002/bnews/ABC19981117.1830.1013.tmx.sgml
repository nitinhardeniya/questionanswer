We have not heard of any real damage being done by the storm.
As Ned said, some precautions were taken.
The Hubble space telescope was turned so its mirrors facedded away from the
incoming meteors.
And as more satellites go into orbit NASA is trying to do more to protect
them.
ABC' Tom foreman reports from Denver.

Out on the windswept Colorado plains, scientists working for NASA
are recreating a dramatic moment in space.
<TURN>
Push the start button.

In space, that instant when a meteoroid collides with a
Satellite.

Excellent!

Joel williamsen is determining if lightweight aluminum foam can
be used to shield a satellite from such impacts.
And his results are striking.
Look at what happens when he fires a small aluminum pellet through standard
satellite shielding made of plate aluminum.
The bullet rips right through.
<TURN>
And you can see we've got a lot of damage to the rear wall, from pieces of
debris that have come off of this shield.

But high-speed photos tell a very different story when the same
kind of pellet hits less than an inch of aluminum foam.
Even though the pellet is traveling 20 times the speed of sound, it rips,
tears, and essentially disintegrates.
<TURN>
It breaks that particle up quite a bit better and you can see it just
places a fine field of aluminum spray over the front of the target space.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
What's more, the aluminum foam weighs 20% less than standard
shielding and can double as a type of space radiator for excess heat on
board a satellite.
All that makes engineers hopeful they can reduce the danger to satellites
by the next time the leonids shower comes around.
