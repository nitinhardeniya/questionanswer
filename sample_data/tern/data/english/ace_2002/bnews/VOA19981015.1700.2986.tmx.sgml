The head of the United Nations development program is warning that the
economic turmoil affecting much of the world poses a particular danger to
the poor. The UN official also says this financial turbulence highlights
the need for overhauling the mechanisms of international economic aid.
VOA's Rick Nunez has the story.

UN DP head James Gustock Spake* says the economic upheaval that erupted in
Asia has darkened an already dismal outlook for the world's 1.3 billion
people who live on less than $1 <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day</TIMEX2>. Mr. Spake says the Asian financial
crisis already has taken a considerable toll on extremely poor countries,
especially those in Africa. He points out <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>'s projected economic
growth for the continent shrank from more than four percent to about one
percent. In Asia itself he says the economic malaise is hitting
impoverished citizens quite hard.

Indonesia, Thailand, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, each of these
countries have admirable records in human development and in poverty
reduction, but there has been an enormous reversal of fortune which has
impacted most heavily on the poor within these countries. If down trends
continue, the World Bank estimates that the number of people in poverty in
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines will more than double
from some $40 million to more than $100 million as a result of the crisis.

The UN official says the precarious economic climate in Asia, Russia, and
elsewhere has also dispelled a number of popular theories.

Gone are the myths that globalization is working well. That most of the
developing world is doing fine economically. And that Asia is blazing the
trail for the other developing countries to follow. And gone also are the
notions that progress can be left entirely to the wisdom of the market,
that government itself is hardly necessary.

Mr. Spake says successfully tackling the Asian economic virus will require
a whole new framework for mobilizing international financial aid, one that
is not motivated by short-term political or military interests. He believes
the new model should broaden the scope of economic assistance beyond the
traditional government to government system. By channeling aid directly
into programs that strengthen the private sector and civil society. He said
another component of the new model will allow some countries to temporarily
suspend debt repayment while negotiating new time table with creditors. But
James Gustov Spake warns no program will work without increased
international leadership from the United States. He adds that U.S. policies
are not reflective of a country that has the biggest stake in the success
of economic globalization. The process he says is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-15T17:49:46.63" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> on trial. Rick Nunez,
