The government released another batch of internal e-mails from Microsoft's
files. In the messages, Microsoft executives describe some of their own
software as a club to be used against Apple Computer. Other messages appear
to describe a campaign by Microsoft to force Apple to break its close
relationship with Microsoft's rival in the Internet software business,
Netscape. On the videotape, recorded in August, government lawyers
questioned Bill Gates closely about many of these e-mail messages. Gates
denied that Microsoft had tried to force its competitors to do anything. He
often said he didn't remember the e-mail messages in question or that they
were taken out of context. Microsoft gets to play other sections of the
videotape which may strengthen the company's case on Wednesday. Dan
Charles, NPR News, Washington.
