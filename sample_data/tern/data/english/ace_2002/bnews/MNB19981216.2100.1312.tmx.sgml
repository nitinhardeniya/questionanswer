Kevin Tibbles, it is quite possible that, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-16T21:21:52.62" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>, you mentioned for the first
time what appears to be -- and we see more flashes from this earlier tape.
This is how bad it was earlier.
Incoming fire has triggered the outgoing fire.
But earlier it appeared they were very, very anxious on the Iraqi end.
<TURN>
Well, I guess you could say so.
In the beginning I started to wonder as to whether or not they wanted to
put on some sort of show of force because they knew something was headed
their way and perhaps the Iraqis themselves wanted to put on a display to
show they were defiant.
The first time the air raid sirens went off here and we rushed to the roof
and nothing happened.
The second time they went off, it was after the anti-aircraft fire was
going to the sky and it has been basically going up almost nonstop in some
part of Baghdad or another throughout <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-16TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the evening</TIMEX2>, Brian.
<TURN>
We were watching pictures there of you when the first volley went up.
You came up to the roof without a helmet and flak jacket.
And quickly in protective gear.
Kevin, just to set the scene, there is a mosque across from the ministry of
information and perhaps I can say this, but you can't with your minders and
sensors where you are, it was thought for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="vague duration">some time</TIMEX2> by NBC news
correspondents there was an anti-aircraft battery on the roof where you
are, the ministry of information.
We've had that confirmed <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-16TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> because of the firing going on?
<TURN>
Yeah.
The number of times I've been in the city and I was here throughout <TIMEX2 val="1998-SP" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
springtime</TIMEX2> in <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the early parts of the year as well</TIMEX2>, there's always been
something up there.
We've always seen it.
We never heard the music.
We didn't know whether or not it worked.
It's very clear as to the Ringing in my ears at this point that thing is up
there and it is operational and they're planning to use it <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-16TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">tonight</TIMEX2> as they
are in various places across the city.
And I can tell you in <TIMEX2 val="P2W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-W49" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the two weeks we've been here <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-16T21:21:52.62" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, we have been out
and about in this country in various places.
And I'm just sort of going to restrict what I say because I don't know
whether it's going to cause any problems for me here if I do, but there --
we see these sorts of things all over the place here in Iraq.
I can't tell you how sophisticated they are, but I can tell you they are
using them <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-16TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this evening</TIMEX2> quite extensively.
<TURN>
Understood, Kevin.
I also understand you were paid a visit by the minister of information <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-16TEV" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
evening</TIMEX2>?
<TURN>
Well, the Iraqi officials here have all of a sudden become very interested
in what it is that we do.
I think up until perhaps the release of Richard Butler's report, the chief
weapons inspector, people thought this was once again going to go away.
Once Butler's report was given to Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the
United Nations, intentions began to rise.
We've been visited by a number of occasions on the roof by Iraqi officials
and soldiers.
They want to know what kind of equipment we have, where it is, and what
we're planning to do with it.
For that reason, it's very clear to me that the monitoring of our acts here
is going to a different phase.
When we go to the streets to interview people, we're tailed by Iraqi
officials and that effects what people are saying to us out in the street.
Because basically we're hearing that they're defiant and they're willing to
die for this <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-16T21:21:52.62" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2>.
That's what they're telling us on the streets right here.
Who know what is <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-17TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the sunup</TIMEX2> is going to bring.
Are people going to go to work, stay home?
No one knows.
All we know is Saddam Hussein has put out a radio message to his people
telling them to be defiant, but we don't know where Saddam Hussein is at
