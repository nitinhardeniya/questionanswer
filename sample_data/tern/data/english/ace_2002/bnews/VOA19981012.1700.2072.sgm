Aid agencies operating in war-stricken southern Sudan
say the Sudanese government has joined rebels in extending a cease-fire to
facilitate delivering humanitarian aid. Last week, the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army said it would extend the cease-fire for three months when
it expires on October 14. In a statement issued to the aid group Operation
Lifeline Sudan, the Khartoum government said it, too, will observe a
three-month extension Wednesday.
