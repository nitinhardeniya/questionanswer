Business travelers often bring all their luggage on board in
order to avoid baggage claim and save time on the ground.
But when united airlines begins installing new stainless steel frames at
security checkpoints <TIMEX2 val="1998-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next month</TIMEX2>, the goal will be to stop bulky bags in
their path.
It's the latest in a long line of airline efforts designed to beat the
carry-on crunch.
<TURN>
Most business travelers probably are aware of what the policies are and
they'll deal with it, you know?

But experts worry about longer lines at security and a greater
fear -- lost luggage.
<TURN>
Lost luggage claims, since the airlines have cracked down on carry-on bags,
have gone up.
So over <TIMEX2 val="P2M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last two</TIMEX2> or <TIMEX2 val="P3M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">three months</TIMEX2>, we've seen more luggage lost.
So I think that the problem is only gonna get worse.

Continental is trying to find its solution on board -- new planes
will have larger overhead bins.
And the airline is retro-fitting <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-15T21:47:20.09" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> planes to make more room.
