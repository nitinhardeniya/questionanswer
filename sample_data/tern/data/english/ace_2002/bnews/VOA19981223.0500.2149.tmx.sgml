And Israel says its upcoming early elections will not delay implementation
of the Y River peace agreement provided Palestinians uphold their end of
the Accord. Both the Palestinian authority and the Untied States had
reacted sharply to reports that the peace process would be frozen during
the election campaign which could extend into <TIMEX2 val="1999-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May</TIMEX2>. But, an Israeli
government spokesman said, <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>, Israel will carry out its commitments
under the Y Accord regardless of the election, as long as the Palestinians
do the same.

Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu has suspended troop withdrawal until the
Palestinians meet five demands. These include confiscation of illegal
weapons, and an end to the proposed declaration of a Palestinian state. The
Palestinians assess they are compiling with the Y River agreement, but say
Mr. Netanyahu is setting new conditions.
