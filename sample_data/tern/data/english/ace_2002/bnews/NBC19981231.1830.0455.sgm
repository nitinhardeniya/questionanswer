But over the last 12 months, the Dow gained nearly 1,275 points.
The NASDAQ rose 622 points for the year.
On a year that will go down as the one when millions decided to run with
this market.
Mike Jensen has this story.

It's the year the stock market became the national pastime.

Good afternoon, everybody.
This is M.G., along with the person who will cure your financial ills, the
stock doctor.

David Woodland of Aberdeen, Washington, follows the market on TV
all day long, reads about it in the newspaper, goes online to check out his
stocks.
Five years ago, his retirement nest egg was worth just $60,000.
Today, it's worth $220,000.
And he's shopping for a vacation home.

He's one of 130 million Americans who made the stock market the
hottest game in town this year -- better than the lottery.
For the last four years, almost everybody has been a winner.
1995 -- the Dow shoots up 33%.
'96 -- 26%.
'97 -- 23%.
This year -- 16%, even with the late summer plunge.
Incredible gains.
$6 trillion in profits created out of thin air.
Why the surge in stock prices?
Mostly because of the booming economy.
Eight years of prosperity and still no recession in sight.
<TURN>
The U.S. economy is in very good shape and will grow at a strong pace in
1999.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Where does that leave the market for 1999.
<TURN>
I think a first quarter decline on the order of 15% to 20% will be followed
by a strong balance of the year, ending the year with a net gain of 7% to
10%.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
So on the eve of the new year, most analysts say, as long as the
world economy doesn't disintegrate, the good times on Wall Street will
probably keep rolling.
That the Bulls may slow down a bit, but they're not ready to quit.
