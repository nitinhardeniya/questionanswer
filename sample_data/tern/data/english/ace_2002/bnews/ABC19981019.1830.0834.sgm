In Montreal tomorrow, researchers will lay out a -- possible cause of
multiple sclerosis.
At least 300,000 Americans have Ms. it can be debilitating and some people
die from it.
The question is, what triggers Ms. researchers will present their evidence
at at a conference of the American neurological association.

By the time she arrived at her doctor's office, Marie brancato
was experiencing many of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis.
<TURN>
Real confused.
Can't concentrate.
Losing my balance.
And it got so severe to where I was seeing double vision.
That's when I really got scared and nervous.

In multiple sclerosis, the body's immune system attacks nerve
fibers, leaving them scarred and hardened, and that disrupts nerve signals.
Scientists have long suspected this process is triggered, by a virus, but
they could never identify which one.
Now, researchers in Milwaukee may have done just that.
Here, at the institute of viral pathogenesis, they examined blood and lymph
nodes from Ms patients and found evidence of a single, active virus.
They examined brain tissue and saw it again, and in the exact areas where
nerve fibers were being destroyed.
<TURN>
Where there is inflammation, where there is bad stuff going on, where there
is disease, that's where we see the vis.

The virus is called human herpes virus-6 or hhv-6.
Hhv-6 is normally harmless.
In fact, most of us are infected during childhood.
But in some people, some adults, the virus seems to reawaken and turn
destructive.
No one is certain why.
The good news is, there are drugs to fight this virus, drugs which might
actually reduce many of the symptoms of Ms. not only might these
medications help patient who don't respond to existing treatments,
remarkably, they might have the potential to actually stop the progression
of ms.
<TURN>
We now have a target.
We now have something specific that we can go after.

They've even developed a blood test to show when the virus turns
active.
When Marie brancato was diagnosed with Ms last year, her blood test
revealed plenty of active hhv-6.
Now, taking an anti-viral drug twice a day, there's no sign of it.
As for her physical condition --
<TURN>
Back to exercising.
Back to my normal routine.
That's excellent.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
While more studies are needed to confirm these results, finally
linking multiple sclerosis to a specific virus might allow patients like
brancato to help for a more normal life, while moving one step closer to a
Cure.
