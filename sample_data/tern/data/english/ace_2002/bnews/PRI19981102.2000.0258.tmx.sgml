The government released another batch of internal e-mails from Microsoft's
files. In the messages, Microsoft executives describe some of their own
software as a club to be used against Apple Computer. Other messages appear
to describe a campaign by Microsoft to force Apple to break its close
relationship with Microsoft's rival in the Internet software business,
Netscape. On the videotape, recorded in <TIMEX2 val="1998-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2>, government lawyers
questioned Bill Gates closely about many of these e-mail messages. Gates
denied that Microsoft had tried to force its competitors to do anything. He
often said he didn't remember the e-mail messages in question or that they
were taken out of context. Microsoft gets to play other sections of the
videotape which may strengthen the company's case on <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>. Dan
Charles, NPR News, Washington.
