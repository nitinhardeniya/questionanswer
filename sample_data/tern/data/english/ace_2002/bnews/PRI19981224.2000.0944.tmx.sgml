The case of Nellie Campobello sounds like the stuff of fiction, appropriate
perhaps for a novelist from <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Mexico's golden age</TIMEX2>. In <TIMEX2 val="193" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">her heyday</TIMEX2> of <TIMEX2 val="193" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
1930s</TIMEX2>, Campobello was a cultural luminary, a pioneer choreographer and the
author of the books "Gartucho " and "My Mother's Hands." Campobello was
last seen in public in <TIMEX2 val="1986" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1986</TIMEX2>. Since <TIMEX2 val="1986" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">then</TIMEX2>, her only apparent contact with the
outside world has consisted of conversations with a mysterious man named
Claudio Fuentes Figueroa. Hold on, the plot thickens <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-24T20:15:44.82" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>. But let's get
Mexico City-based journalist Peter Gresta in on the story at this point.
Hi, Peter.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Peter_Gresta </ANNOTATION>
Hi, how are you?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullins </ANNOTATION>
Fine, thank you. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-24T20:15:44.82" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>, at this point, once again, we should remind people
that no one except this man, Claudio Fuentes, claims to have seen Nellie
Campobello for <TIMEX2 val="P12Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past 12 years</TIMEX2>. And something very strange happened <TIMEX2 val="1998-W52" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this
week</TIMEX2> to move the story forward. What was it?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Gresta </ANNOTATION>
Well, what happened was that there are some investigators who have been
actually looking for Nellie Campobellos, who, as you say, has lived the
life of a recluse apparently for <TIMEX2 val="P1DE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="199" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past decade</TIMEX2>. And in fact, they found
her body in a very small rural cemetery with a grave with -- only marked
with her initials. And they found a death certificate dated <TIMEX2 val="1986" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">12 years ago,
<TIMEX2 val="1986" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1986</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullins </ANNOTATION>
Gosh, so she's been underground for <TIMEX2 val="P12Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1986" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">12 years</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-24T20:15:44.82" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2>?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Gresta </ANNOTATION>
That's right. So it seems that Claudio Fuentes, the man who claimed to have
had conversations with her, as he said, wasn't telling the truth <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">all this
time</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullins </ANNOTATION>
And he claims to have been speaking with her. At one point, he was even
going to lead, I guess, some investigators to see her. But then, halfway
through the trip, he decided that he wouldn't do it after all, he changed
his mind?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Gresta </ANNOTATION>
That's right. This character is a very mysterious kind of chap, and he
seems to have been the sort of guardian and protector of Nellie Campobello
and her heritage over <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-24" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the years</TIMEX2>. But the fact is that <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-24T20:15:44.82" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> he's vanished,
along with a rather spectacular collection of artworks apparently.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullins </ANNOTATION>
What kind of artworks are we talking about?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Gresta </ANNOTATION>
Well, we're talking about paintings and sculptures and so on, some writings
from a lot of Nellie Campobello's contemporaries -- people like Diego
Rivera and Jose Clemento Orozco, artists who were around in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the golden era
of <TIMEX2 val="192" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1920s</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="193" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1930s</TIMEX2> in Mexico's modern cultural explosion, if you like</TIMEX2>.
This collection really represents a cross-section of art work from some of
the finest artists of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">that period</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullins </ANNOTATION>
There are some in the literary community who actually resent the way that
they claim Claudio Fuentes was taking Nellie Campobello <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1986" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="not sure which years these were">all those years</TIMEX2>, or
supposedly taking care of her.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Gresta </ANNOTATION>
Clearly, Claudio Fuentes had a very strange and unusual relationship with
Nellie Campobello. He was -- had power of attorney over estate. But he was
also charged with kidnapping her back in <TIMEX2 val="1985" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1985</TIMEX2>. Now, that particular charge
was thrown out of court for lack of evidence. But nonetheless, that
incident and his relationship with Nellie Campobello has raised an awful
lot of questions as to exactly how much control he exerted over her, over
her estate, over her life -- particularly over <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1986" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="From earlier context - the years before 1986">the last few years of her
life</TIMEX2>.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullins </ANNOTATION>
And do police have any kind of suspicions as to where he may have gone? Do
they think he fled the country?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Gresta </ANNOTATION>
I don't think that they believe he may have fled the country. But
certainly, they're extending their search across the country. They are
concerned about what -- about his whereabouts. They certainly want to find
him, track him down. There is a very strong suspicion that he's in charge
of or he has control of this art collection and that he knows an awful lot
more about exactly what happened to Nellie Campobello <TIMEX2 val="1986" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">12 years ago</TIMEX2>.
