One more note on campaign financing -- federal election commission auditors
said the 1996 campaigns of both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole should repay
millions of dollars in taxpayer matching funds because they coordinated and
benefitted from their parties' so-called "issue ads."
That is illegal.
The Dole campaign was told to pay back a staggering $17.7 million, the
clinton campaign, $7 million.
The justice department is also investigating.
