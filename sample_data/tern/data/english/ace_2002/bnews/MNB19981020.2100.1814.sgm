The Middle East peace talks taking place in the state of Maryland were
deemed to be too sensitive at a sensitive stage, at least, sensitive enough
to bring in a man respected by both sides and just might make a difference
at this case.
Enter king Hussein of Jordan, who arrived today.
He interrupted cancer treatments to attend.
He appeared thin and gaunt in a photo released last week.
The president attended for the fifth straight day, trying to broker a
Land-for-peace deal.
Clinton held a one-on-one meeting with Arafat late in the day.
And the state department is describing the meetings as a phase of hard
bargain.
They'll go late tonight.
