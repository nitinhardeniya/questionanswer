And one of the most powerful forces in American politics is the Christian
conservative movement.
It should expect to do very well in a state like Alabama where the
incumbent governor is one of their own.
But, surprise, here's NBC's Fred Francis.

He's behind by 25 points and Alabama governor fob James James, a
Champion of the religious right may be riding the so-called victory train
out of the office.
Governor, the polls are ugly.
<TURN>
They are always ugly for me.

No, I mean they're really ugly.

Nationwide, republicans have the edge in 9 of 11 governors races.
But here, democrats are exploiting a rift James helped to create
conservatives and economic.
<TURN>
He alienated not just the business community, but the more middle and
upper-class, traditional republicans by his association with the religious
right.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
In support of the Christian conservative ideas, some say James'
behavior has been embarrassing.
Walking like an ape to show his disapproval for teaching the theory of
evolution.
And threatening to call out the national guard to protect a display of the
ten commandments in a courtroom.
But at Lakeside Baptist church in Birmingham, many here say, like Jesus,
they've had a friend in fob.
<TURN>
Christians of all denominations and all races will be supportive of
governor James, simply because he stood with the church on issues that are
close to us.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Christian conservatives have flexed their political muscle for
fob James in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-27T18:49:47.00" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the past</TIMEX2>.
In <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>, they're credited with helping him overcome a ten-point deficit
with <TIMEX2 val="P1W" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">only a week to go</TIMEX2>.
He went on to win the governor's seat by one point.
Ex-Christian coalition director, Ralph Reed, says Christians must "go to
the wall" for James this time, too, in a race he says is a referendum on
pro-Christian issues.
Yet local pundits say it's more about competing values than a measure of
the political punch that Christian conservatives can throw.
<TURN>
Voters are choosing between values and this election it looks like they're
going to choose more of the education and job side of values as opposed to
the prayer and ten commandments side.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
That's no secret to James' opponent Don siegelman who proposed a
State lottery to fund education.
And in a state where one out of every three adults is function functionally
i will literate is a political idea which if successful could spell the
last stop for governor fob James and the last meaning full loss for the
christian right.
