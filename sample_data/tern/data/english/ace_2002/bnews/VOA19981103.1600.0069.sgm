On another subject, Ms. Albright has intervened in a dispute holding up
Israeli action to ratify the new interim of peace agreement with the
Palestinians. She phoned Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu after he
postponed a Cabinet meeting that was supposed to debate the agreement. Mr.
Netanyahu said the Palestinian security plan was not complete. However,
State Department spokesman James Rubin says the Palestinians have met their
responsibilities by submitting a plan to combat terrorism.
