A new
United Nations report described what it calls "horrifying" human rights
abuses by Taliban soldiers in Afghanistan. The report says Taliban forces
captured the northern city of Mazari Sharif in <TIMEX2 val="1998-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">August</TIMEX2>. Taliban soldiers
went on a killing frenzy against minority Shi'ites. The report says as many
as 8,000 people, including babies, were murdered. The author was unable to
get into Afghanistan but says he based his account on reliable sources. The
Taliban calls the report "imodinary" and an insult to Islam.
