Mitsubishi is cutting up to 1,000 jobs in Illinois and California, under a
Major restructuring plan.
That's about 20% of Mitsubishi's U.S. workforce.
They will be eliminated in the next two years.
The Japanese automaker will also reduce the number of models it now offers
by 40%.
These moves come, as Mitsubishi reports heavy losses for the first half of
this year.
Mitsubishi says it's been hit hard by the economic crisis in Asia and a
Sharp drop in car sales in Japan.
