At least six people have been killed in Jakarta, Indonesia, during a clash
between two religious groups.
Hundreds of Muslims burned a Christian church and a gambling hall.
They threw rocks at soldiers, who responded with warning shots and tear
gas.
Muslims say fighting broke out after reports that a group of Christians had
attacked a mosque.
Last week, anti-government demonstrations claimed at least 16 lives.
