When it comes to impeachment what is the mood outside the capital?
That depends on how far outside you go.
We talked to columnists from three different regions of the country.
<TURN>
The northeast is probably the most pro-Clinton section of the country in
the sense they don't want to see him thrown out.
What surprises me about this is the way the republicans don't recognize
this could be a threat to their holding not only the house, but the Senate.
There are more republican senators up for re-election in <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the year 2000</TIMEX2> than
there are democrats.
With the presidential cycle coming up, when turnout is larger, it tends to
benefit democratic candidates.
I think it's likely the republicans will lose the house and possibly even
the Senate, if the house votes to make the Senate put this guy on trial.
<TURN>
People made up their minds about Bill Clinton <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">as far back as 1992</TIMEX2>.
They heard about Gennifer Flowers, they heard about the draft, they knew
what they were getting when they elected this guy, and they elected him --
and they re-elected him.
So I think this notion that people are going to wake up and dawn -- it's
going to dawn on them that Bill Clinton has cut corners and he hasn't been
fully truthful, we know this.
And people knew it <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-13T18:42:10.42" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">a long time ago</TIMEX2> and based on that knowledge, decided
they were going to elect him anyway.
<TURN>
There is more support for the impeachment process in the south than
probably in any other region of the country.
I'm fairly convinced that what seems to be happening is the right course.
I think the house is going to impeach him.
And as in the case of Andrew Johnson, kids will learn that this president
was not convicted and served out <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="alternate calendar (political)">his term</TIMEX2>.
But he will serve out <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="alternate calendar (political)">his term</TIMEX2> with quite a stain and the references in the
encyclopedias will always say in the first two sentences that he was the
second president to be impeached.
<TURN>
Some opinions from outside the Beltway.
