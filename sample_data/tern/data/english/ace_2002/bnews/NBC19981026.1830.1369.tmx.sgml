<TURN>
Some people say that you may have earned as high as $4 million so far.
Is that possible?
<TURN>
That could be very possible.
I don't know.
Nobody ever told me.
<TURN>
From the time you were 14 and you started really earning money, did you

no.
When I was young, I had no clue.
I didn't even know they were paid a lot of times.
Nobody would tell me.
I didn't know about the money.
I didn't care.
I did it because I loved to win, and that was that.
