We're going to take "A closer look" tonight at faith and the first
amendment.
There is always a certain amount of controversy that surrounds the
celebration of Christmas.
It's about the government, religion, and who has the right to display what
where.
Who can put up a nativity scene or cross, and where can they do it?
It gets to the very heart of freedom of religion in this country and the
separation between church and state.
Our religion editor Peggy Wehmeyer reports, the lines are anything but
clear.

When the city of San Diego began decorating for Christmas, a
Local church sent residents a very public reminder of the reason for the
season.
<TURN>
We were sharing what we believe is great news, that that baby that was born
in Bethlehem came for a purpose.

The church called them Christmas cards to the city -- more than
300 billboards and bus Shelter ads about Jesus.
But the metropolitan transit board, which prohibits advertisements about
sex, alcohol, drugs and religion, pulled the church ads off of every bus
shelter.
<TURN>
We're in the category of alcohol, drugs and tobacco?
Is it offensive that God is opening his arms to everybody and offering
forgiveness of sins?

San Diego is one of many cities across the nation debating the
role of religion in the public square.
It's the December dilemma, when Christmas carols in public schools and
manger scenes in front of city halls challenge the courts to determine just
how high to raise the wall between church and state.
In turon, Kansas, the mayor demanded a cross come off the town Christmas
tree.
<TURN>
She took the Christ out of Christmas, taking that cross down.

In Chester, South Carolina, a Jewish family was forbidden to put
a menorah by the town tree.
And in Somerset, Massachusetts, a federal judge has ruled that the town's
60-year-old tradition of placing a nativity scene in front of the town hall
is illegal.
Charles Haynes is a religious freedom scholar at the freedom forum first
amendment center.
<TURN>
The first amendment protects our right to express our faith in the public
arena of America.
But the first amendment prohibits the government from endorsing religious
speech r M citizens can put up religious symbols on public property if
other religious symbols are allowed, but the government cannot.
Government displays must be secular.
So in Somerset, the city tried to minimize the sacred by adding an 18-foot
santa, frosty the snowman and some reindeer.
<TURN>
I'm horrified by Santa claus towering over the creche.

In Somerset, the courts ruled the government had entered into the
religion business.
But in San Diego, the government may have gone too far the other way, by
restricting citizens' free expression of religion.
<TURN>
The government has no business discriminating against religious speech when
it allows other kinds of speech in the public forum.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
When the transit board was challenged on that point, it backed
down.
<TURN>
We made a mistake.
I think we have to own up to that.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
The church ads are going back up in bus shelters in time for
christmas.
But in many parts of the country, this thorny December dilemma is far from
being resolved.
