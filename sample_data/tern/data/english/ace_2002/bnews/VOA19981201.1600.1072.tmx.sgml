Thank you very much, Tony. The president of football's world governing
body, Seb Bladder, says the ideal length of the World Cup finals should be
<TIMEX2 val="P30D" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">30 days</TIMEX2>. That is <TIMEX2 val="P3D" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three days</TIMEX2> less than <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>'s World Cup played in
France. Bladder said the <TIMEX2 val="P30D" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">30-day</TIMEX2> timetable would be possible in <TIMEX2 val="2002" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2002</TIMEX2> because
the first phase involving 32 teams will be played in two countries: Japan
and South Korea. FEBA's next task is to reallocate the number of qualifying
positions from the six confederations. This is needed because for the first
time, three teams will gain automatic entry to the tournament: hosts South
Korea and Japan and title holder, France. FEBA is expected to make the
announcement at the end of. European cup football champion, Club Real
Madrid of Spain, has beaten South American champion, Vasco DeGama 2 to 1 in
the Intercontinental Cup in Tokyo. Steven Shayman has the details of the
game from the Japanese capital.

Real Madrid striker, Raoul Gonzales, scored the tie-breaking goal with
<TIMEX2 val="PT8M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">eight minutes</TIMEX2> remaining to give his side a two to one victory in its first
World Cup Championships since <TIMEX2 val="1960" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1960</TIMEX2>. Gonzales took in Dutchman Clarence
Seadorf floating past before putting the ball past Vasco DeGama's Brazilian
goal keeper, Carlos Dramano. The more than 51,000 spectators at Tokyo's
national stadium saw Vasco DeGama's Nasa miscalculate in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored">the 25th minute</TIMEX2>
and hit the ball into his own net to give Real Madrid a 1 to nothing lead.
Vasco's Junino came back to net the equalizer in <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored">the 56th minute</TIMEX2> after Real
goal keeper, Buto Ilkner, fumbled the ball amidst the Vasco offensive
flurry. It was to international match in which six yellow cart, three to
each side, were handed out. Both teams displayed top caliber skills and
finesse, but Real Madrid sealed its win by capitalizing on Vasco's
occasional <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Time on soccer clock">second-half</TIMEX2> sluggishness. Steven Shayman for VOA News, Tokyo.
