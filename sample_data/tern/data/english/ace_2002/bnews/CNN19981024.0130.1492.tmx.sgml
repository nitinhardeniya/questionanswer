20th century fox's new movie is facing a problem of royal proportions.
A newspaper reports that Thailand plans to block filming of "Anna and the
king," starring Jodie Foster and Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat.
The movie will be a remake of "the king and I."
The paper says Thai officials feel the film would violate a law against
insulting the royal family.
The <TIMEX2 val="1956" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1956</TIMEX2> movie with yul brynner was banned in Thailand for the same reason.
