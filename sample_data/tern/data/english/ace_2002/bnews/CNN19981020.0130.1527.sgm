The royal yacht "britannia" opened to the public Monday, after serving as a
Traveling home for the royal family for almost 44 years.
The luxurious 412-foot ship was retired in December, because it had grown

It now is permanently docked in Scotland as a tourist attraction, expected
to draw 200,000 visitors a year.
