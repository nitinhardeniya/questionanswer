There are some American popular songs that almost everyone on earth who
listens to the radio has heard and can probably even sing along to. One of
them was written <TIMEX2 val="1968" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">30 years ago</TIMEX2> by country singer Jerry Jeff Walker. Carolyn
Weaver has the story behind the song.

Jerry Jeff Walker's grandmother gave him his first guitar when he was <TIMEX2 val="P13Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">13
years old</TIMEX2> growing up in New York state's farm country. As soon as he
finished high school, he took off to hitch hike around the country and play
music. In New Orleans in <TIMEX2 val="1965" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1965</TIMEX2> when he was 23, he met a street minstrel and
dancer who inspired his best-known song.

Everybody on the street has a nickname. That's kind of the way it is. I was
a kid, and the other guy was Whitey, and he was Bojangles.

Some country music encyclopedias say that Jerry Jeff Walker met Bojangles
in the New Orleans drug tank, the part of the jail reserved for those
arrested for public intoxication. Mr. Walker says it was something else.

There had been a murder in the French Quarter and police were rounding up
everybody to look like they were searching so they could show the arrest
records were up and everything. But basically, they just wanted street
dancers people. And I kind of got thrown in with that group and arrested
during <TIMEX2 val="1965-WXX-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a weekend</TIMEX2>, and it was <TIMEX2 val="1965-WXX-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the long weekend</TIMEX2>. It was <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a holiday</TIMEX2>. We found
out somebody's been researching it. <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="holiday">Columbus Day</TIMEX2>, it was <TIMEX2 val="1965-WXX-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> and it was
closed, so I got arrested on <TIMEX2 val="1965-WXX-05TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday night</TIMEX2>, so <TIMEX2 val="1965-WXX-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="1965-WXX-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="1965-WXX-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, and
<TIMEX2 val="1965-WXX-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, so I got to spend <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="vague duration">quite a bit of time in jail</TIMEX2>, and I met this old
character who had taps and stuff and they called him Bojangles. And we
talked for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="vague duration - long weekend">that period of time</TIMEX2>, and we talked about being with minstrel
shows and traveling and had a dog, and the dog got killed on a highway, and
blah, blah, blah, and stuff, so I kept him in my little mind. And later on,
when I was looking for a character to put in one of my songs, that was it.

Jerry Jeff Walker didn't write the song until <TIMEX2 val="1968" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three years later</TIMEX2>. He
remembers his record company first thought it was too long for the radio
and too slow, but listeners to one New York radio station kept calling in
requests for it. In <TIMEX2 val="1971" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1971</TIMEX2>, "Mr. Bojangles" became a top ten hit for the
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. It has since been covered by everybody from John
Denver to Neilsen, to Nata Simone. But the real Mr. Bojangles, the
silver-haired tap dancer with the became of him. Did Bojangles ever contact
you and say "I heard the song"?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Walker </ANNOTATION>
Hmm-mm, never saw him again.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Weaver </ANNOTATION>
He was an old man?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Walker </ANNOTATION>
Hmm-mm, old white guy.

According to BMI, the music licensing group, "Mr. Bojangles" has been
played more than 4,200,000 times on television and radio. That would mean
the song's had <TIMEX2 val="P29Y" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="this isn't the number of years it's been played, it's how long the song lasts x 4200000. Not sure if this is anchorable, since the songs are played at the same time.">nearly 29 years of air time</TIMEX2> as if it had been playing
nonstop almost since Jerry Jeff Walker wrote it in <TIMEX2 val="1968" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1968</TIMEX2>. It seems
appropriate that Jerry Jeff Walker is the one singer who can make it sound
fresh again. I'm Carolyn Weaver.
