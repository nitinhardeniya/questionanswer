Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has condemned recent religious clashes
and appealed for calm. Mr. Habibie today said it was wrong to attack any
house of God and that the government will not tolerate any religious or
ethnic discrimination. On Monday, thousands of Christians rioted in remote
Eastern Indonesia setting fire to mosques and Muslim-owned businesses. No
one was injured in that violence which hit the town of Kupang in West
Timor. The trouble followed a rally by Christians protesting last week's
religious unrest in Jakarta where Muslim youths attacked several churches.
At least 13 people were killed in that outbreak of violence.
