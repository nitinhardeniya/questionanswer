As I often point out, the parallels between your country and mine are
sometimes so staggering, they defy explanation.

But Eddie Mear will do his best to explain in this week's letter from
London.

Your government is rocked by a woman called Lewinsky: dark floppy hair,
perhaps a little overweight, and an amazing story to tell which has
embarrassed people at the very top. Our government is rocked by a man
called Shayla : dark floppy hair, perhaps a little overweight, with an
amazing story to tell, which could embarrass people at the very top.
Actually, Mr. Shayla must be the only man in recorded history to spend four
months in a French prison and come out a few pounds heavier than when he
went in. He was in the French jail awaiting a legal ruling on whether he
should be sent back to Britain to face charges under the official Secrets
Act. This is the law, which as its name suggests, is supposed to protect
all the U.K.'s most highly sensitive government information. David Shayla's
alleged crime was to tell a newspaper that when he was a British spy,
Britain tried to assassinate Colonel Khaddhafi, something the British
government denies. A warrant was issued for his arrest, and he was
eventually tracked down to Paris, thrown in jail, with a view to bringing
him to Britain and making him stand trial. The French courts judged his
alleged crime to be political, so extradition treaties don't count. Mr.
Shayla is now staying in a Paris hotel as a guest of the Sunday newspaper
which first published his allegations. We were all braced last Sunday for a
fresh set of revelations from Mr. Shayla about what our Secret Services
have been up to in our name, but none came. On Monday night, we found out
why. He told the BBC he wants to do a deal with the British government. He
will say no more about their dirty dealings if they drop all the charges
against him. As I say, although the cases of Lewinsky and Shayla have some
similarities, there are key differences. Shayla, for example, is his own
mouthpiece. Ms. Lewinsky had the help of her good friend, Linda Tripp. More
importantly, every detail of Ms. Lewinsky's story is in the public domain.
Here in Britain, only tiny morsels of David Shayla's revelations have been
made public, thanks to that Official Secrets Act I was talking about. We
still have no freedom of information law, and the government announced
yesterday it's in no hurry to introduce one. If I was to say much more
about this story, I'd be in breach of the Official Secrets Act. I would end
up in prison myself. These people from the Security Services don't mess
about, you know. Hold on, I think there's someone at the door.
