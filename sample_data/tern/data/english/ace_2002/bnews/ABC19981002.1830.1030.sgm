In Berlin today, one of the world's most famous places has been rededicated
after more than 50 years.
In the 1920s and '30s, the potsdamer platz was Europe's center of arts and
culture.
After world war II, the Berlin wall ran right through it.
Today it's once again filled with theaters and shops.
"50 years couldn't kill this place," said someone today.
"Life will is back here".
