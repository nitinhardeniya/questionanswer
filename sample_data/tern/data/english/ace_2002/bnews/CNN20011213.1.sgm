treaty

(CNN) -- President Jiang Zemin has told President George W. Bush of
China's concern regarding Washington's withdrawal from the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

However, the reaction from Jiang and other senior officials has been
mild.

And the only condemnation of American "unilateralism" has come from
commentaries in the official media.

While traveling in Myammar, Jiang held telephone conversions with Bush
and Russian counterpart Vladmir Putin.

The official media on Friday quoted Jiang as relaying to the two
presidents Beijing's stance on the ABM treaty, and in particular, the
importance it placed on "upholding the international system of arms
control and disarmament."

"China will continue to make its efforts in upholding peace and
stability in the world," Jiang said.

The Chinese president, however, stopped short of criticizing the U.S.
decision to abandon the ABM treaty.

In a briefing on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhang Qiyue
had expressed "regrets and worries" about Washington's move.

She also called on the U.S. to adopt a "cautious" attitude on the
matter and to consult international opinion.

Mild reaction

Diplomatic analysts in Beijing said the reaction from Chinese
officials had been remarkably mild compared with the strong stance the
leadership had earlier taken on the ABM issue and on Bush's deployment
of a national missile defense system.
 
Jiang is unsure about the deals the U.S. has struck with Russia The
analysts said Jiang did not raise a strong protest partly because he
was not sure about the deals that the U.S. might have struck with the
Putin administration on the issue.

The official Chinese media as a whole did not play up the news about
ABM on Friday.

However, a number of articles attacked the U.S. decision bitterly.  A
commentary carried by the influential Xinhua news agency Web site said
Washington's withdrawal from the AMB treaty was "a victory for the
hawkish faction."

Saying the Bush administration was again pursuing "unilateralist"
policies, it hinted Washington was taking advantage of its success in
the war against terrorism to further boost its global dominance.
