We've said that all Australians with nonessential business should defer
their travel to Yemen.
Those Australian tourists in Yemen would be well advised to get out of the
country.
Those who have to be in Yemen should confine themselves to the major towns,
travel outside of the major towns obviously is somewhat hazardous.
A Britain and an American were wounded.
The rest of the hostages were unharmed.
The kidnappers demanded release of two leaders of the Islamic Jihad.
