This week on the "cold & flu report" -- eating well is one of the best ways
to avoid a cold or the flu.
Nutritionists say, eating good foods, especially fruits and vegetables with
a wide range of vitamins, can help maintain a strong immune system.
Many experts also advise drinking lots of water to flush out the body's
systems and keep toxins from building up.
But doctors say, when it comes to the flu, the best prevention of all is to
get a yearly flu vaccine.
