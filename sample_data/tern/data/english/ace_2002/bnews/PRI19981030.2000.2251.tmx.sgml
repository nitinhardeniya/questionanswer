Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of dance music to bring you
a special bulletin from the intercontinental radio news. At <TIMEX2 val="T19:40-06" comment="Quote from War of the Worlds broadcast 60 years earlier.">20 minutes
before 8 central time</TIMEX2>, Professor Fowler of the Mount Jennings observatory,
Chicago, Illinois, reports observing several explosions of incandescent gas
occurring at regular intervals on the planet Mars. The spectroscope
indicates the gas to be hydrogen and moving toward the earth with enormous
velocity.

<TIMEX2 val="1938-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sixty years ago <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, those words sent the nation into a panic. This
famous radio broadcast went on to tell listeners that the United States was
being invaded by Martians. Phone lines were jammed by frightened listeners.
Inhabitants of entire apartment blocks ran out to the streets. Thousands of
people fled New York. It's estimated that one million Americans believed
the news bulletin they were hearing, although they were in fact listening
to a radio play, The War of the Worlds, directed by and starring Orson
Welles. He changed broadcast history so stunning was its realism.

I'm speaking from the roof of broadcasting building New York City. The
bells you hear are ringing to warn the people to evacuate the city as
Martians approach. Estimated in <TIMEX2 val="PT2H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Quote from War of the Worlds - event anchored within the 1938 broadcast">the last two hours</TIMEX2>, three million people
have moved out along the roads, the north.

The estimated 12 million listeners to the War of the Worlds heard that a
meteor-type object had crashed landed onto a farm in a small New Jersey
hamlet. Stunned locals desperate to flee reportedly abandoned their
relatives. Others fired gun shots wildly into <TIMEX2 val="TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="this really isn't temporal. I think night means 'dark' here; but it is a trigger word.">the night</TIMEX2>. Aside from being
the focus of our geography puzzler, <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2> this place is hosting a gala
dinner in a ritzy hotel to honor <TIMEX2 val="1938-10-30TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Date available from immediate context.">the night <TIMEX2 val="1938" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">60 years ago</TIMEX2> when Martians
landed in a small New Jersey town, which <TIMEX2 val="1938" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">60 years ago</TIMEX2> was on the tip of
many Americans tongues</TIMEX2>. So, where are we? The answer, the next time to
interrupt this broadcast.
