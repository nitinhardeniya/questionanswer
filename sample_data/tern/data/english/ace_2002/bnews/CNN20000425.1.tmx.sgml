JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: U.S. and Russian nuclear arms control
efforts were on the agenda <TIMEX2 val="2000-04-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>, as Russia's foreign minister met
with President Clinton at the White House and attended a United
Nations disarmament conference.

CNN's Andrea Koppel reports. 

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

ANDREA KOPPEL, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):
Russia's foreign minister, on the offensive, repeating Moscow's mantra
that the very foundation of arms control hangs in the balance. The
reason, Ivanov warned, the United States wants to modify the Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty.

IGOR IVANOV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): The
collapse of the ABM Treaty of <TIMEX2 val="1972" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1972</TIMEX2> would therefore undermine the
entirety of disarmament agreements concluded over <TIMEX2 val="P30Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last 30 years</TIMEX2>.

KOPPEL: To drive that message home, in <TIMEX2 val="P30D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-04-25" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last 30 days</TIMEX2> Russia's newly
elected president has done what his predecessor couldn't do in <TIMEX2 val="P7Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">seven
years</TIMEX2>, President Putin persuaded the Russian Duma to ratify two arms
control agreements, the Start II Nuclear Arms Reduction Treaty and
another banning all nuclear testing, treaties held up in the
U.S. Congress.

JOHN PIKE, FED. OF AMERICAN SCIENTISTS: It makes Russia look like the
good guy and it also puts the ball in America's court and is going to
make it a lot more difficult for the United States to deploy a
national missile defense.

KOPPEL: Difficult because Putin's government has issued a direct
challenge to the United States and is working with U.S. allies in
Europe to oppose national missile defense and altering the ABM
treaty. And while a Russian-European alliance is unlikely, Putin's
attempts to gain leverage seem to be working.

MICHAEL MCFAUL, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: Part of
Putin's strategy is to be friendly on arms control issues and other
kind of state-to-state issues and in return for that he wants the West
to get out of his own backyard, and first and foremost, Chechnya.

KOPPEL (on camera): U.S. officials say they don't know what Putin's
motivation was in pushing for early ratification, but welcome Russia's
response. And rather than acting ashamed for lagging behind, the
U.S. says it's led the way in arms control for <TIMEX2 val="P7Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last seven years</TIMEX2>.

Andrea Koppel, CNN, the State Department.
