Hit by a devastating drought last summer, the state of Texas is hit by some
of the worst flooding in half a century.
Hardest hit, the area southwest of San Antonio.
Jim Cummins is in Victoria, Texas, tonight.
Dozens of rivers and streams in Texas are out of their banks tonight
driving more than 7,000 people from their homes, flooding more than 60
counties from San Antonio to the gulf of Mexico.
Today the city of Victoria, Texas, was swamped by plood water from the
guadalupe river, hardest hit, old Victoria, worst flood here since 1936,
city officials say.
The river looks more like a lake, four miles wide in some places.
At noon stella nava rushs to the water's edge to look for her stepson's
house.
It's gone.
<TURN>
His house was on stilts, a little house.
It's not there.
<TURN>
The people who live in this neighborhood say at sunrise this morning the
streets were dry.
By noon, this place was a swamp.
This woman's house is under water.
<TURN>
We never really thought it would get in the house.
We thought eight inches off the floor would save the furniture.
It didn't.
<TURN>
Police, the national guard have rescued scores of people trapped in their
homes, including this man, who was reluctant to leave.
In Houston, the water is still rising in some places on the brazos and San
jacinto rivers.
Today, three people in a tree had to be rescued by a boat.
In San Antonio where the flooding began Saturday, rescue workers are still
finding bodies.
Today a 37-year-old man.
<TURN>
This is just not the fun part of the job having to go in and find somebody
that did not make it or we weren't able to get to in the first place.
<TURN>
Victoria is now under curfew, and for now there is no rain in the forecast.
