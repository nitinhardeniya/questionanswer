The parents of the world's only surviving set of octuplets are no doubt
praying for the condition of their newborns to continue to improve.
Doctors in Houston, Texas say right now, they are progressing well. At a
news conference today, Dr. Patty Saverick, said the medical team is excited
about the babies' progress. She said the smallest baby is doing better, but
is still sicker than the others. The mother of the eight babies remains in
stable condition. Doctors say she will stay in the hospital at least
through the weekend, but the infants are expected to remain hospitalized
for several weeks. Now American citizens, the parents were both born in
Nigeria, they announced that they given their two boys and six girls
traditional Ebo tribal names. They said the names symbolized the strength
and guidance of God. The smallest and most fragile of the babies, a girl
who weighed just 320 grams at birth is named Odera, shortened from a
longer name meaning God has my life in the Ebo language.
