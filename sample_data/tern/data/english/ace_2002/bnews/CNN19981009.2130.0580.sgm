The house has passed legislation that would make it tougher for the
overextended to erase their debts.
President Clinton is threatening to veto the proposed changes in bankruptcy
law.
Opponents say they would plunge financially strapped families into debt for
the rest of their lives while giving too much advantage to credit card
companies.
Supporters say the changes will clamp down on bankruptcy abuse.
Personal bankruptcy filings have jumped 300% since 1980.
