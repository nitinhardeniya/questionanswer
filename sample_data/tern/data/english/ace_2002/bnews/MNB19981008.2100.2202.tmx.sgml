First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton spent <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">her day</TIMEX2> in her adopted hometown of
Little Rock, Arkansas and even though it wasn't on the official agenda she
was once again defending her husband, the president.
The very man whose actions have so publicly embarrassed her.
Ron blome joins us from Little Rock.

Linda, there was from the first lady to direct mention of <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>'s vote in
the house but she was clearly on a mission.
In fact she just left the hotel behind me from a political fundraiser.
Her mission though is to shore up support for local candidates, to honor
some heroes and to remind the Congress that there are other issues
confronting America.
<TURN>
In this Congress, even though they only have <TIMEX2 val="PXD" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-08" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">a few days</TIMEX2> left, it is not too
late for them to do something good for the children and people of America.
<TURN>
Hillary Clinton taking a swipe at Congress for an agenda too short on
domestic accomplishments and too long on politics.
On <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored - pragmatically present reference">the day Congress began the impeachment inquiry of her husband</TIMEX2>, she was
home in Arkansas to honor civil rights heroes who in turn honored her
courage with applause and warm embraces.
<TURN>
Should be proud to have a first lady like her.
<TURN>
And here in the president's hometown, friends who want it over with
quickly.
<TURN>
Let's either move forward and impeach, or let's shove that aside and get to
the business of the nation.
<TURN>
But it was at a democratic rally where Hillary Clinton, the defender,
served up her message that America needs to put domestic issues ahead of
partisanship.
<TURN>
We're able to put progress over partisanship, we're able to put unity over
division, we're able to get about the business of continuing to try to lift
people up, not tear them down.
<TURN>
Linda, it's as if the first lady is on a bit of a campaign swing here.
Her message -- don't give up.
Get out the vote, but she was not taking any questions from reporters, as
the impeachment machinery rolls forward in Congress.
<TURN>
I want to ask you about something else that is quite an issue for both
Clintons -- the Paula Jones case.
In fact we've heard that it's Mrs. Clinton who finally gave the go-ahead to
her husband's legal team to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-08T21:36:42.85" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recently</TIMEX2>.
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-08T21:36:42.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>, of course, we have some very ominous developments.
What can you tell us about that?
<TURN>
Well, the two sides are about $300,000 apart in reaching a settlement.
The attorneys say talks are still going on but they're nowhere close.
<TIMEX2 val="1998-10-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Today</TIMEX2> a federal judge in Little Rock order the release, the opening of the
Paula Jones case file.
That's to come <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday, October 19</TIMEX2>.
On <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 20th</TIMEX2>, they will argue the appeal and also as we reported on the
"today" show the president's lawyer faxed a letter pretty much disavoiding
everything he said during the president's deposition saying, see, there was
no sex.
The president's lawyer <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-08T21:36:42.85" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> distancing himself from some of the words he
used during that process.
<TURN>
All right.
We will have to see how significant that comes to be.
