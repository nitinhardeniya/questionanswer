That's right, Tom. And it's still do or die for baseball's Atlanta Braves.
Heavily favored to make it to the World Series, but they still have their
backs to the wall, you might say. They avoided being swept by the San Diego
Padres in the best of seven National League Championship series by winning
game four in San Diego on <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> 8-3. The Braves were down 3-0 and on the
verge of heading home much earlier than expected. But a solo homerun by
Javier Lopez and a grand slam by Adres Galeraga highlighted an 8-3 win to
keep Atlanta's hopes alive. Game five of the series will be played in San
Diego, starting in <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-12T20" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about three hours from <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-12T17:18:16.49" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, with Atlanta sending John
Smoltz to the mound. Andy Ashby will try to close out the series for the
Padres, and he knows what's at stake.

I'm just going out with the same attitude I've had <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="might be a sports season, and therefore shouldn't get a val, but it's hard to tell">all year</TIMEX2> is just try and
go out and concentrate on what I have to do. You know, take it one pitch at
a time, one out at a time, and try and stay away from the big innings and
just keep us in the game where we have a chance to win.
