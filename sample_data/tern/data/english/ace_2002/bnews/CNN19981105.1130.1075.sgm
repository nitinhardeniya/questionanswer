Ticketmaster is suing the Internet music retailer n2k, claiming it
defaulted on payments and broke an agreement to become ticketmaster's
exclusive on-line music dealer.
Under their deal reached earlier this year, n2k agreed to pay ticketmaster
$12 million over two years.
Ticketmaster says the first installment was due this past week.
