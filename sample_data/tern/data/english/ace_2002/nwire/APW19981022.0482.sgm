VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Efforts to organize a team to verify
compliance with the Kosovo peace deal appeared stalled Thursday
because would-be contributor nations want the U.N. Security Council
to endorse the plan before they will commit personnel.
Work on the U.N. resolution hit a snag Wednesday night because
Russia and China oppose including language threatening Serbs and
ethnic Albanians with force if they disregard the agreement.
As permanent members, China and Russia could veto the
resolution.
Under the Oct. 12 deal with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow up to 2,000
unarmed ``verifiers'' to ensure that the terms of the deal are
carried out.
The operation is to be directed by the Vienna-based Organization
for Security and Cooperation, which must ask its 54 member states
to provide personnel for the mission.
On Thursday, the OSCE permanent council met in Vienna's Hofburg
Palace to work out details for the operation. But representatives
said no final decisions were taken because many members first
wanted the Security Council to approve the mission.
The American head of the operation, William G. Walker, said
there was concern among the would-be contributors about the safety
of personnel, especially from countries whose nationals were taken
hostage by Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
Under the agreement, the Yugoslav government guarantees the
safety of the verifiers.
``Obviously, the physical security of 2,000 people in a zone of
turmoil, of conflict, is of utmost importance,'' Walker said. ``I
feel very strongly that I will be sort of personally responsible
for the well-being of these 2,000 people, for their lives.''
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said his government was
ready to provide 50-100 personnel but did not want to rely
exclusively on Milosevic for their safety. Axworthy suggested that
armed bodyguards accompany verifiers.
``We raised clearly the importance of providing robust
protection for anyone who is going to Kosovo,'' Axworthy told
reporters. ``We think it is very important that the U.N. Security
Council has a resolution that clearly authorizes measures to
protect anybody who is in Kosovo.''
He said Canada was holding out hope that the council would
authorize ``all necessary measures'' to protect the mission,
wording which diplomatic sources at the United Nations say is
unlikely to win approval.
Walker saaid he would leave for Kosovo on Friday and spend about
a week or 10 days helping set up the operation.
