NEW YORK _ John O. Van Koert, a prominent New York designer who
helped promote the fascination with Danish modern furnishings in
the 1950s, died last Sunday in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 86.
The cause was a stroke, said a friend, Edith Siroto.
Van Koert designed silverware and furniture that helped to
introduce modernist shapes. Born in Manitoba, Canada, he later
moved to Milwaukee, where he studied at the University of Wisconsin
to be a painter and sculptor and taught design in the art
department. After World War II, he settled in New York as a jewelry
designer for Harry Winston and branched out into industrial design.
His flatware designs in silver for Towle were well known in the
'50s. One of them, ``Contour,'' a sleek Miro-like design, was
chosen to represent modernism in ``Knife, Fork and Spoon,'' a 1951
traveling exhibition on the history of eating implements organized
by the Walter Art Center of Minneapolis.
In 1954, he was exhibition director of ``Design in
Scandinavia,'' a show that traveled for three years, to venues
including the Brooklyn Museum of Art; it helped introduce
Scandinavian modern design to Americans.
Van Koert's furniture designs for Drexel, a North Carolina
manufacturer, were presented in model rooms in department stores
like Abraham &AMP; Straus, Macy's and Bloomingdale's..
Van Koert was an early advocate of the built-in furniture
popular in the 1950s with modernist architects and designers.
Predicting a time when people would treat furniture like kitchen
cabinetry, he said in an interview in 1958: ``We shouldn't have to
move our furniture when we move. After all, you can't get
sentimentally attached to a $200 chair.''
In 1974, he started working for Serried Ltd., a North Carolina
furniture manufacturer, where he designed traditional home
furnishings for 20 years. Van Koert, who left no survivors, moved
to Santa Fe in 1993.
