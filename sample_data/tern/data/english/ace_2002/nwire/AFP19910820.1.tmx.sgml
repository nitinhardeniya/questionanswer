man was shot dead as bursts of automatic weapons fire broke out near the Russian 
parliament building. 

The protester was crushed by a tank that ploughed over barricades erected by 
demonstrators on the ring road that encircles the Moscow city center. 

The body of the shooting victim was discovered near the U.S. embassy but the 
circumstances of his death were not immediately known. 

Another protester was wounded in a tank charge on the ring road, where several 
vehicles placed across the road by protesters as a barricade caught 

Armoured vehicles were set up as blockades around the ring road. One of the 
blockades was located in front of the Agence France-Presse office in a building 
that houses other western media including Reuters news agency, the BBC, CBS and 
The New York Times. 

Gunfire was also heard near Gorky park in the southwest of the city center. 

"What are you doing? You can see you are firing on your Russian brothers," one 
of the protesters on the ring road shouted at a soldier. 

"We were ordered to come here. All we ask is that you let us leave again," the 
soldier answered. 

Crowds of demonstrators who were gathered near the Russian parliament building 
remained calm despite the sporadic gunfire.
