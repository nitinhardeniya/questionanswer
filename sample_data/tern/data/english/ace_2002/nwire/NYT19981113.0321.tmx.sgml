Negotiators in the talks at Buenos Aires, Argentina, on global
warming were locked in a last-minute struggle <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-13TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday night</TIMEX2> to
resolve key questions that seemed merely procedural _ but that in
reality went to the heart of the politically charged question of
how fast the world can and should move to deal with the prospect of
climatic change.
At issue were the shape and pace of the work schedule for
putting flesh on the bones of the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement
reached <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year ago</TIMEX2> in Japan under which industrialized countries
have committed themselves to make legally binding reductions in
emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon
dioxide.
Mainstream scientists say that if the emissions are not reduced,
the world's climate could be seriously disrupted in <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="199" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="not sure this means starting now or the future">coming decades</TIMEX2>.
As the Buenos Aires discussions opened on <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 2</TIMEX2>, virtually all
major figures in the talks said that the measure of their success
would be the successful adoption of a work schedule. But as the <TIMEX2 val="P12D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-13" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">12
days of negotiations</TIMEX2> approached their scheduled end of <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-13T24:00" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">midnight
Friday</TIMEX2>, no accord had been achieved.
The work schedule is crucial because it will govern how soon
operating rules are established for the mechanisms of achieving
emissions reductions. Not until <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-13T18:54" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="Hypothetical future date when work schedule will be decided on.">then</TIMEX2>, assuming the Kyoto Protocol
is ratified by the required countries including the United States,
can the protocol truly take effect.
<TIMEX2 val="1998-11-13" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Late in the day</TIMEX2>, the conference chairwoman, Maria Julia Alsogary
of Argentina, circulated a draft proposal establishing a <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="Or 'year 2000'?">two-year</TIMEX2>
deadline for fashioning the operational rules.
As <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-13T24:00" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">midnight</TIMEX2> approached, there was cautious optimism. ``I think
it's likely we're going to reach closure, but the clock is
ticking,'' said Dirk Forrister, a member of the U.S. delegation. It
was clear, he said, that the deadline would be extended: ``We're
going to be going into <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-14" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the wee hours'' of Saturday</TIMEX2>.
At Kyoto, the industrialized countries agreed to reduce their
emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which are
produced mainly by the burning of coal, oil, wood and natural gas,
by an average of about 5 percent below <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2> levels in <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next 10</TIMEX2>
to <TIMEX2 val="P14Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">14 years</TIMEX2>. The United States' reduction would be 7 percent.
Developing countries so far have no specific targets, but are
required in general to control their emissions.
One of the two operational mechanisms established at Kyoto is
called emissions trading. It would allow a country or private
company to achieve its cuts partly by buying reductions from a
country or company that has reduced its emissions more than
required.
In theory, say the method's proponents, this would bring about
faster reductions at lower cost. They say this has been proved by
an emissions trading system for reducing industrial sulfur dioxide
emissions in the United States.
The other arrangement, called the clean development mechanism,
is designed to enable rich countries to invest in
emissions-reduction projects in poor countries. One example is
high-efficiency power plants that emit less carbon. In this way, in
theory, the poor countries would reap both environmental and
economic benefits. The investor and the recipient would share
credit for the emissions reductions achieved.
One sticking point in Buenos Aires involved which of the two
mechanisms should receive priority. Many developing countries,
seeing the prospect of reaping new investment in their economies,
wanted the rules and regulations for the clean development
mechanism to be worked out first, on an accelerated schedule, with
those for emissions trading completed later.
The United States and other rich countries feared that if the
clean development mechanism received first priority, developing
countries would then refuse to approve rules and regulations for
emissions trading. Developing countries have been suspicious of
emissions trading, fearing that it might be used by any given
industrialized country as an excuse for not reducing its own
emissions as much as it could or should.
The United States therefore insisted that the two mechanisms
move toward operational status on parallel tracks.
As the Buenos Aires session moved into <TIMEX2 val="PTXH" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-13" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">its final hours</TIMEX2>, the
parallel-track idea appeared to be ascendant. Ms. Alsogaray's
proposal would require that ``substantial progress'' on rules for
the operational mechanisms be demonstrated <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year from <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-14T18:54" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, with a
firm decision in <TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">two years</TIMEX2>.
Between the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yearly</TIMEX2> benchmarks, according to a U.S. proposal,
more frequent high-level discussions would attempt to speed the
decisions.

One particular obstacle in the way of eventually making
emissions trading a reality is an insistence by the European Union,
backed by some developing countries, that a limit be placed on the
amount of a country's emissions reduction target that could be
achieved through trading. The United States adamantly argues that
this would rob the arrangement of its cost-cutting value and allow
fewer reductions, worldwide, as well.
