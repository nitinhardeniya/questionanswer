   When Lyuma picked up his gun last October to fight Russian troops
pouring into Chechnya, he abandoned everything: his family, friends
and a comfortable life-style afforded by his successful business.

A rebel with a cause, Lyuma has learnt the value of his possessions
and the price of the Russian enemy he has been fighting these past 12
months.

In early September he returned to his home village to soothe the fears
of his anxious mother who thought him long dead.

But the long months of war and hardship have not dulled his flair for
business, and his homecoming resulted in the sale of his Western brand
jeep so that he can buy guns and ammunition for his guerrilla band.

"I'm going to get them from Chechens working in the (civilian)
administration and the pro-Russian police," said Lyuma, explaining
that many Chechens working for Moscow continue to co-operate with the
separatists.

If that doesn't work, he says he'll try his luck with the Russian
soldiers who are supposed to be his sworn enemy.

"The soldiers in isolated mountain bases are demoralised. We buy their
weapons off them or swap them for vodka," Lyuma says.

"They're not risking anything. They can say they used up all their
ammunition, and they know that we're not going to attack a supplier,"
the 32-year-old says with a broad smile.

Led by Vakha Arsanov, Lyuma and his fellow fighters focus their
attacks on convoys of Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers
which criss-cross Chechnya in an effort to impose Moscow's military
might.

"The main thing is to push off right after the attack, before the
Russian's helicopter gunships get involved," says Lyuma, his
comrade-in-arms Abdula Soltomuradov nodding in agreement.

Earlier this month, Lyuma and his seven fighters failed to retreat
quickly enough after destroying four armoured personnel carriers in a
sneak attack.

"They worked out our positions and started bombing us," he said. "We
fell back into a village where we didn't know a soul.

"In the end, one of the elders negotiated our departure from the
village with the Russians.

"So we hid our weapons and managed to get out without them even
knowing who we were, and all for 900 rubles (around 32 dollars),"
Lyuma said.

Even in the heat of battle, the rebels have found that, as in the
first war, money talks.

"At the height of the war, we were with (warlord) Ruslan Gelayev's men
when we got surrounded," he recalled. "For 2,000 dollars we got
out. With money, anything's possible."

"We hope that the conflict between the Russians and the Chechens,
which has lasted for centuries, will end with our generation," said
Abdulah, a father of three who has not seen his children for six
months.

"That's why we are fighting for our independence," added the
39-year-old mason who dreams of picking up his tools once more when
the war is over, and rebuilding his home, and his life.

Lyuma sees no immediate end to the war, but remains confident of the
final outcome: "We know that they won't leave easily, but we will not
give in.

"They (the Russians) are fighting for money, medals and
promotion. We're fighting for our land. We'll see who's the most
tenacious."
