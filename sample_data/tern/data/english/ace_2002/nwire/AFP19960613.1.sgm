   The leader of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic 
Party in the Siberian town of Novokuznetsk was killed on Thursday, Russian news 
agencies reported, citing the party's press service. 

Vladimir Oberderfer was shot several times in the head while carrying out 
political duties, the press service said. 

However, the Interfax news agency said Oberderfer was killed while he was buying 
cigarettes and was known by law and order forces as the leader of a criminal 
group and not for his political activities.
