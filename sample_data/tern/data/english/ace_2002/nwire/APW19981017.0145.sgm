Russian consumer prices up 45 percent since August

MOSCOW (AP) _ Consumer prices have soared 45 percent since
Russia devalued the ruble and put off its foreign debts two months
ago, according to Central Bank and government statistics, a news
report said Saturday.
A key architect of the Aug. 17 devaluation and default plan,
former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, said in an interview
published Saturday that he was not to blame for the ensuing
economic meltdown and predicted things would only get worse.
Economic analysts with the Interfax news agency said they
calculated the consumer price estimate based on figures from the
Central Bank and the State Statistics Committee. It gave no other
details.
Prices jumped immediately after the crisis hit and imports _
which Russia had come to rely upon for half its consumer goods _
plunged. Basic foods have remained available and the government
insists it doesn't expect shortages, though the lowest grain
harvest in decades has aggravated concerns about feeding the
world's largest country.
Kiriyenko said it wasn't supposed to turn out so badly. He told
the daily Kommersant that the government that replaced him, widely
seen as a compromise to appease President Boris Yeltsin's hard-line
foes, is not prepared ``to take unpopular, harsh measures _ and
those are exactly what needs to be taken.''
He said the 90-day moratorium on debt repayments declared Aug.
17 was supposed to be followed up with an agreement on repayment
terms within 60 days _ a period that ended Saturday with no such
plan.
With the debts to come due in a month, the government has yet to
announce how it will tackle Russia's worst economic crisis since
the 1991 Soviet collapse. Russian negotiators held talks on
restructuring the debts with Western bank creditors in London this
week but failed to reach an agreement.
``It has become clear. ... There will be no strict anti-crisis
program, instead there will be populist measures, there will be
more spending than revenues, and as a result, we won't be able to
pay off our debt,'' Kiriyenko said.
Kiriyenko blamed the Communist-dominated parliament for
resisting a tough anti-crisis program.
``I was told, `We all understand that yes, there's a crisis,
yes, there's threat of collapse, but you have to understand _ we
have elections in a year,''' Kommersant quoted him as saying.
In the two months since the crisis hit, the ruble has nosedived
from 6.29 against the dollar to 17.1.
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister for social issues suggested price
controls on medicines during a visit to Greece on Saturday. Russia
depends heavily on imported medicine, and rising prices are feeding
the black market, Valentina Matvienko told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
The European Union may revise its aid to Russia in light of the
crisis, European Commission President Jacques Santer told Interfax.
About 140 million ECU (dlrs 115 million) in EU aid is spent on
Russia annually.
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed to Santer for
food and medicine aid earlier this month.
