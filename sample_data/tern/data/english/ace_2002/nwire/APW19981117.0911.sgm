PARIS (AP) _ Jean-Pierre Papin, one of France's all-time great
strikers, ended his playing career Tuesday, saying he wanted to
spend more time with his family.
``I am going to grant myself a long break devoted to my family,
especially my daughter Emily,'' who is disabled, Papin said at a
news conference.
The 35-year-old scored 326 goals in 584 matches for eight clubs
and the French national team.
Papin, who is retiring completely from playing, said he would
coach the amateur team of Arcachon in south west France.
In 54 matches for France, including 11 as captain, Papin scored
30 goals _ a record bettered only by Michel Platini _ and played in
the 1986 World Cup finals and 1992 European Championships.
Papin made his last appearance for the national team in 1995.
Papin shot to fame in 1986 after signing for Marseille, where he
scored 181 goals in 279 games, won four championship medals and was
top French goalscorer for five seasons.
His goals helped Marseille reach the 1991 European Cup final,
which it lost to Red Star Belgrade in Bari, Italy.
``If I had one regret, it would be that I never won the European
Cup with Marseille. I have replayed that final in Bari so many
times,'' Papin told French sports daily L'Equipe.
After transferring to AC Milan in 1992, Papin won a European Cup
medal in 1994, though he didn't play in the final against his
former club Marseille.
Papin also played for Bayern Munich, helping the German club win
the UEFA Cup in 1996, before moving back to France.
After a spell at Bordeaux, Papin moved to French second division
club Guingamp in pre-season, but struggled to hold down a place.
Papin, who also played for Vichy, Valenciennes and Bruges, said
that he is a very different person from the ``temperamental, naive
and inexperienced,'' youngster that signed for Marseille.
``I thought that I knew alot of things about which I knew
nothing,'' he said.
``I have changed a lot, that is clear. I have been divorced, had
setbacks, injuries and put confidence in people that I later
regretted,'' he told L'Equipe.
``But what changed me above all was Emily. She changed the
center of gravity of my life away from soccer,'' he said.
