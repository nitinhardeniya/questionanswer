   The plans announced Tuesday by three of Russia's largest banks to merge throw 
the spotlight on the power and influence of the country's powerful business 
barons and bank-owners. 

They are known popularly as the "Magnificent Seven" -- though they number more 
than seven -- or simply the "oligarchy", and wield enormous influence behind the 
scenes and in the Kremlin. 

Between them they control almost the entire Russian media and own a sizeable 
proportion of the nation's wealth. The best known of them are: 

Boris BEREZOVSKY (52). By far the best known internationally, and the most 
controversial. Bank-rolled Boris Yeltsin's presidential campaign in 1996, was 
formerly deputy secretary of Yeltsin's security council, and is currently 
executive secretary of the Commonwealth of International States. Survived an 
assassination attempt in 1994. Heads LogoVaz, Russia's largest auto-dealer, owns 
majority holding in Aeroflot and Sibneft. LogoVaz has 3 percent holding in gas 
giant Gazprom, owns ORT and TV6 television stations and Nezavisimaya Gazeta. 
Sued Forbes Magazine for running an article about him entitled "Is he the 
Godfather of the Kremlin?", alleging that he was a major force behind the 
Russian mafia. Listed by Forbes as the world's 97th richest man with accumulated 
wealth of three billion dollars. 

Vladimir GUSINSKY (45). Chairman of Media Most group (television, newspapers, 
banking, real estate), to which Most-Bank belongs, one of the three banks 
involved in Tuesday's mega-merger. A former theatre director, now cites US media 
mogul Rupert Murdoch as a role model. Became director of US-Soviet joint venture 
Most in 1989, and built up Most-Bank, then closely linked with Moscow Mayor Yury 
Luzhkov, and has now gambled on new Russian appetite for entertainment and news. 
Media empire owns flagship daily Sevodnya, NTV television, Itogi magazine, and 
Moscow Echo radio. 

Mikhail KHODORKOVSKY (35). Owns 40 percent holding in Menatep Bank, involved in 
the merger with Most-Bank and Onexim, and Rosprom holding company (banking, 
oil). Controls 89 percent of Yukos, Russia's second largest oil company, which 
he acquired at a privatisation auction in 1995 for 168 million dollars. Annual 
revenues for Yukos, which has now diversified into metals, chemicals, shipping 
and real estate, are now around three billion dollars. Menatep is also deeply 
involved in food-processing, textiles and construction. Founded Menatep, then a 
trading company, in 1987, and Menatep Bank in 1990. Made a fortune trading 
foreign currency, sugar, grain and oil. In 1991 served as deputy prime minister 
of fuel and energy industry. Ranked by Forbes as 123rd richest man, with wealth 
of 2.2 billion dollars. 

Vladimir POTANIN (38). Known as the "baby billionaire", is head of the Interros 
financial group (banking, real estate, oil and gas, ferrous metals) of which 
Oneximbank, the third of Tuesday's merger trio, is a part. A former official at 
the Soviet trade department Soyuzpromexport, joined Interros as director in 
1991, and founded Oneximbank in 1993. Owns 85 percent of oil company Sidanko and 
51 percent of Norilsk Nickel. Former director of Association of Russian Banks, 
served in 1996 first deputy prime minister of Russia. Media interests include 
Izvestia and Komsomolskaya Pravda. Was declared recently by Business Week to be 
"the most powerful man in Russia". His companies are worth around 32 billion 
dollars and his personal wealth is estimated at between 1.5 billion and three 
billion dollars.

SBS-Agro, the troubled bank. An economist, he became president of SBS joint 
stock company in 1989. Media interests include Kommersant Daily.
