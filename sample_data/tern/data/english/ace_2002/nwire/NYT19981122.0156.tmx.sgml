CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ A communications satellite that will beam
the first uncensored television programs into western Russia and
Siberia began orbiting the earth on <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-22" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> after being sent into
space atop an unmanned Delta 2 rocket.
The Boeing Co. launched the $150 million project after <TIMEX2 val="P3D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-22" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">three
days of technical delays</TIMEX2> for Hughes Space and Communications Co. of
Los Angeles, which built the satellite and a ground station for a
private media group in Moscow.
``It is an unusual moment,'' Vladimir Goussinsky, chairman of
Media Most, the Moscow company, said through an interpreter on
<TIMEX2 val="1998-11-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day the rocket was scheduled to lift off</TIMEX2>. ``I would
dare to call it quite a revolution.''
The 12-story rocket remained on the launching pad for <TIMEX2 val="P3D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-22" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">three days</TIMEX2>
while workers replaced a fuel-level sensor, resolved data relay
problems with the satellite and removed a safety railing mistakenly
left in place around the rocket's main engine. The rocket was
finally airborne at <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-22T18:54" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">6:54 p.m. Sunday</TIMEX2>.
<TIMEX2 val="1998-11-22T20:08" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Some 74 minutes later</TIMEX2>, the rocket released the barrel-shaped,
26-foot-tall satellite into orbit 801 miles above the earth. The
spacecraft will remain there for <TIMEX2 val="P6D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-22" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">six days</TIMEX2> before a motor lifts it
to its working spot about 23,000 miles above Kenya.
Named after the Media Most subsidiary responsible for its
operation, the satellite, BONUM-1, is the first Russian satellite
to be manufactured and launched in the United States. It also is
the first privately owned Russian satellite and the first not
subject to military or government control. <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Early next year</TIMEX2>, after
its operating systems are inspected, the satellite is expected to
begin broadcasting 50 channels of news, movies, sports and
children's shows into homes equipped with small receiving dishes.
None of the foreign or domestic programs will be reviewed by
censors for the state.

The system has 200,000 potential subscribers in western Russia
and among Russian speakers in Israel, according to The Associated
Press.
The launching reflected ``the global nature of our industry,''
Darryl Van Dorn, Boeing's manager of commercial Delta flights, said
in a statement. ``Nearly half of our launches <TIMEX2 val="1999" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2> are for
international commercial communications companies. The vast
majority of our business is providing launch services to satisfy
the world's hunger for information services.''
