    The mayor of a western Siberian city was seriously injured when a bomb 
exploded near his car as he was driving to work Wednesday morning, according to 
news reports. 

Mayor Yuri Timoshenkov of the city of Nizhnevartovsk, 1,500 miles east of 
Moscow, was hospitalized in intensive care, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
Two of his bodyguards were also injured. 

The bomb was concealed in a car parked on the side of the road and exploded when 
Timoshenkov was driving by, said Maj. Nikolai Sidorov, a spokesman for the local 
branch of the Federal Security Service. 

No motive for the attack was given. 

The car that held the bomb was completely destroyed in the explosion and 
investigators could not identify its license plate number or the exact model of 
the Russian Zhiguli make, Sidorov said.
