test launched Aug. 31, for delivering weapons of mass destruction
over a long distance.

representatives of the United States, Canada, Japan, France,
Germany, Russia, as members Its aim is to control exports of
missiles capable of carrying nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons, as well as the relevant technology.
