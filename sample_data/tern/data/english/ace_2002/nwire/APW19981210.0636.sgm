Bank of England cuts interest rates by 0.5 percent

LONDON (AP) _ Citing a global economic slowdown and the risk of
deflation, the Bank of England cut a key lending rate by half a
percentage point Thursday _ the third cut in as many months.
The bank reduced its base rate for loans to commercial banks
from 6.75 percent to 6.25 percent. Building societies and banks
immediately announced a drop in mortgage rates.
Analysts and businesses welcomed the move, but warned of a sharp
downturn in the British economy.
``A cut of at least half a percent was essential to boost
flagging consumer demand before the Christmas period and also to
help encourage sterling on its downward path,'' said Ian Peters,
deputy director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.
Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at NatWest brokers, called the
decision ``a clear sign that the authorities are becoming concerned
about the risk of deflation in the economy rather than inflation.''
Union representatives criticized the cut, calling for a full
one-point fall in interest rates to avoid higher unemployment
levels.
The half-percent reduction was a ``pathetic response,'' union
leader John Edmonds said, adding that the bank's monetary committee
members ``seem to be living in a parallel universe. They should
come into the real world.''
A 19.2-point morning rise on the Financial Times Stock Exchange
100 index of leading British stocks jumped to a 36-point increase
after the midday announcement, reaching 5,705.1.
On Dec. 3, the 11 European Union countries that have signed up
to the European single currency coordinated a rate cut that sent
most of their national interest rates to 3 percent.
Analysts called the move a key step in preparing for monetary
and economic union, and said the difference between British and
European interest rates is likely to fuel pressure for Britain to
join the new European currency after its launch on Jan. 1.
``Even after today's cut, British interest rates are over twice
the level of our European competitors and sterling is still about
10 percent overvalued,'' said Malcolm Bruce from the Liberal
Democrat Party, which supports closer European integration.
