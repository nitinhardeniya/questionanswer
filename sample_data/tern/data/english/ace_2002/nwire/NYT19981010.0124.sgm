Dr. Joseph J. Sandler, a psychoanalyst known internationally for
his major theoretical contributions and a leader of what a
colleague called a ``quiet revolution'' in psychoanalytic thought,
died Oct. 6 at his home in London. He was 71.
The cause was lung cancer, colleagues said.
British psychoanalysis in the mid-1900s was split into divergent
and sometimes competitive schools, one led by Sigmund Freud's
daughter Anna, another by the British analyst Melanie Klein.
Sandler, a member of the Freudian group, was instrumental, through
his writings and teaching, in nurturing a gradual reconciliation of
the two camps, integrating Ms. Klein's ``object relations''
perspective with more classical psychoanalytic drive theory.
Born in Cape Town, Joseph Sandler was trained as an experimental
psychologist before receiving his medical degree from University
College Hospital in London. Joining the British Psycho-Analytical
Society at the age of 25, he worked at the Tavistock Clinic and
later, under Anna Freud, at the Hampstead Clinic (now the Anna
Freud Center).
From 1979 to 1984, Sandler was the Sigmund Freud Professor at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He then returned to England and
became the first scholar to hold the Freud Memorial Chair in
Psychoanalysis at University College, London. After his retirement
in 1992, he remained at the university as emeritus professor until
his death.
During his term as president of the International
Psychoanalytical Association from 1989 to 1993, Sandler emphasized
the importance of empirical research, setting up a summer research
program for analysts and sponsoring an annual research conference,
according to Dr. Robert Wallerstein, a close friend and past
president of the association.
Dr. Otto Kernberg, a New York analyst who is now the
association's president, said Sandler's strong scientific interests
also helped forge links between psychoanalytic thinking and
neurobiology.
A prolific author, Sandler wrote more than 200 professional
papers and edited 44 books, including a classic introduction to
psychoanalysis, ``The Analyst and The Patient'' (International
Universities Press, 1973), which he wrote with Christopher Dare,
Alex Holder and Anna Ursula Dreher. He was the founding editor of
the International Review of Psycho-Analysis and served as editor of
the International Journal of Psychoanalysis.
Sandler is survived by his wife, Anne-Marie Sandler, who is also
a psychoanalyst, three children and seven grandchildren.
