HEADLINE: Two dead, 11 injured in attempt on life of Crimean Tatar leader

A Tatar leader and economic advisor to the speaker of the Crimean parliament was 
severely injured in an assassination attempt in which two people died and 11 
others were injured, the interior ministry announced Wednesday. 

A bodyguard and a driver were killed in the attack on Iskender Memetov Tuesday 
evening and several members of his family were injured when the unidentified 
gunmen opened fire on the group as they were exiting a car outside Memetov's 
house. 

Memetov is a powerful businessman who represents Crimea's Tatar community in the 
Ukraine, the population of which is mainly ethnic Russian. 

He is close to parliament speaker Nikolai Bagrov, a Russian who favors Crimea's 
full independence from the Ukraine. Crimea is currently an autonomous republic 
that is part of the Ukraine. 

Bagrov is a candidate in the presidential election being held in Crimea on 
January 30 and his main opponent is Yuri Meshkov who has called for the republic 
to become part of Russia. 

Lila Bodjurova, a member of the self-appointed Moslem parliament set up by the 
Tatar community in Crimea, said the attack on Memetov was politically motivated. 

The Tatar community was deported from the Crimea to the Soviet far east by 
Stalin for allegedly collaborating with the Nazis during World War II. By 
mid-1992 about half of the surviving Tatar population of 400,000 had returned 
from exile and they are now seeking the restoration of their rights in the 
autonomous republic. 

The community is divided between those that advocate an independent state for 
the Tatars and those that favor negotiating with the Ukraine authorities for 
their rights.
