Dr. Joseph J. Sandler, a psychoanalyst known internationally for
his major theoretical contributions and a leader of what a
colleague called a ``quiet revolution'' in psychoanalytic thought,
died <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Oct. 6</TIMEX2> at his home in London. He was 71.
The cause was lung cancer, colleagues said.
British psychoanalysis in <TIMEX2 val="19" mod="MID" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the mid-1900s</TIMEX2> was split into divergent
and sometimes competitive schools, one led by Sigmund Freud's
daughter Anna, another by the British analyst Melanie Klein.
Sandler, a member of the Freudian group, was instrumental, through
his writings and teaching, in nurturing a gradual reconciliation of
the two camps, integrating Ms. Klein's ``object relations''
perspective with more classical psychoanalytic drive theory.
Born in Cape Town, Joseph Sandler was trained as an experimental
psychologist before receiving his medical degree from University
College Hospital in London. Joining the British Psycho-Analytical
Society at the age of 25, he worked at the Tavistock Clinic and
later, under Anna Freud, at the Hampstead Clinic (<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-10T16:19" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> the Anna
Freud Center).
From <TIMEX2 val="1979" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1979</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="1984" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1984</TIMEX2>, Sandler was the Sigmund Freud Professor at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He then returned to England and
became the first scholar to hold the Freud Memorial Chair in
Psychoanalysis at University College, London. After his retirement
in <TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2>, he remained at the university as emeritus professor until
his death.
During his term as president of the International
Psychoanalytical Association from <TIMEX2 val="1989" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1989</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1993</TIMEX2>, Sandler emphasized
the importance of empirical research, setting up a <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">summer</TIMEX2> research
program for analysts and sponsoring an <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">annual</TIMEX2> research conference,
according to Dr. Robert Wallerstein, a close friend and <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-10T16:19" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">past</TIMEX2>
president of the association.
Dr. Otto Kernberg, a New York analyst who is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-10T16:19" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> the
association's president, said Sandler's strong scientific interests
also helped forge links between psychoanalytic thinking and
neurobiology.
A prolific author, Sandler wrote more than 200 professional
papers and edited 44 books, including a classic introduction to
psychoanalysis, ``The Analyst and The Patient'' (International
Universities Press, <TIMEX2 val="1973" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1973</TIMEX2>), which he wrote with Christopher Dare,
Alex Holder and Anna Ursula Dreher. He was the founding editor of
the International Review of Psycho-Analysis and served as editor of
the International Journal of Psychoanalysis.
Sandler is survived by his wife, Anne-Marie Sandler, who is also
a psychoanalyst, three children and seven grandchildren.
