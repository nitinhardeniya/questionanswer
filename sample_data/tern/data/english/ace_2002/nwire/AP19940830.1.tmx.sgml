    In a gangland-style slaying similar to mafia murders in Russia, Bulgaria's 
top sports official was gunned down in Sofia <TIMEX2 val="1994-08-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. 

State radio said Tsvetan Tsvetanov was killed by pistol shots fired from a 
passing car in Sofia's Iztok district. 

Tsvetanov, 45, headed the national Sports Union, the umbrella group for the 
country's sports clubs. But he attracted more unsavory attention in his position 
as deputy chairman of "Zashtita," or Defense, a group billing itself as 
society's answer to the crime engulfing Bulgaria since the collapse of Communist 
rule in <TIMEX2 val="1989" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1989</TIMEX2>. 

Tsvetanov and the Zashtita organization have frequently crossed security firms 
employing <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-08-30" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> athletes, including many wrestlers. 

Many such firms are widely suspected of being fronts for extortion rackets, 
gambling and smuggling operations. 

But some contend that Zashtita is also a front for gangs.
