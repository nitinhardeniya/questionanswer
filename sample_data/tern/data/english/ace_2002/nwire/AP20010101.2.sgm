A Russian oil company executive was shot to death in Russia's second
city St. Petersburg, the city's prosecutor's office said Friday.

Alexander Volkovsky, president of the Russo-Balt Petroleum company,
was shot several times in the chest in the entranceway to his
apartment building on Thursday, said prosecutor's office spokesman
Gennady Ryabov.

Police found a discarded magazine from a pistol at the scene, but
announced no other leads.

The killing resembled the scores of contract murders committed every
year in Russia. Rivalries between competing firms and conflicts with
organized crime groups can lead to the murders.
