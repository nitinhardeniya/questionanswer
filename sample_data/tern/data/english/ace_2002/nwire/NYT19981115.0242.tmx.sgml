Dr. Marcia L. Storch, an innovator in women's health care, died
<TIMEX2 val="1998-11-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Nov. 9</TIMEX2> at her home in Tenants Harbor, Maine. She was 65.
The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.
She was best known as a private practitioner who was widely
influential in changing the rules of treatment for women in <TIMEX2 val="197" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the
1970's</TIMEX2>. Until <TIMEX2 val="197" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">then</TIMEX2>, relatively few women practiced as gynecologists
and fewer still in the field that came to be known as feminist
medicine, in which women were encouraged to take a hand in making
informed medical decisions for themselves.
``She was the first self-declared feminist physician,'' said
Barbara Seaman, a medical historian.
Phyllis Chesler, a co-founder of the Women's Health Network and
author of ``Women and Madness,'' called Dr. Storch ``both a pioneer
and role model in feminist medicine.''
Dr. Storch was born in Pittsburgh. She graduated from Bryn Mawr
College and the Medical College of Pennsylvania. In <TIMEX2 val="1971" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1971</TIMEX2> she moved
to New York City.
She directed the Adolescent Gynecology and Family Planning
Clinic at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which provided
treatment as well as information on birth control and sexually
transmitted diseases to tens of thousands of disadvantaged
teen-agers.
Before Dr. Storch, Ms. Seaman said, women were expected to leave
the thinking to their gynecologists.
According to Ms. Seaman, Dr. Storch insisted that patients in
her downtown Manhattan practice take an active part in deciding
everything from what form of birth control to use to whether to
attempt childbirth without painkillers. And she aggressively
promoted care for neglected problems like premenstrual syndrome and
menopause.
After her retirement from private practice in <TIMEX2 val="1989" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1989</TIMEX2>, she sought a
wider audience for her approach to medicine as a television and
radio producer. She created specialized programming for family
physicians on the Lifetime medical network, and later became the
head of Ob/Gyn news for the Medical News Network.
Dr. Storch is survived by Jean Hewitt, her partner of <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">20 years</TIMEX2>,
and a sister, Suzanne Storch of Inverness, Calif.
