KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels attacked a village in northern
Uganda and abducted 14 people, and were defeated in a separate raid
on military barracks, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
Lord's Resistance Army rebels on Sunday kidnapped the Ugandans
from near Gulu, about 360 kilometers (225 miles) north of the
capital, Kampala, the independent Monitor newspaper said.
Later that day, an unspecified number of rebels were captured
during their raid on Agoro barracks, about 520 kilometers (325
miles) north of Kampala, the Monitor reported.
Security sources said a ``fierce and decisive'' battle at the
barracks lasted for two hours. They provided no casualty figures.
The LRA usually attacks soft targets such as schools, markets
and villages.
Defense Minister Stephen Kavuma, who has been designated as army
spokesman on rebel activities, could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.
Early this week, the government-owned New Vision newspaper
quoted the army as saying between 200 and 300 LRA rebels had
entered Uganda from bases in southern Sudan.
New Vision quoted the army as saying a captured rebel had said
the rebels were accompanied by women who were to act as porters.
The rebels normally use abducted schoolgirls as porters and
concubines, while boys are trained as fighters.
Sudan has admitted supporting the LRA in retaliation for
Uganda's assistance to the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which
has been fighting the Islamic government in Sudan for 15 years to
press for increased autonomy and development in the country's
south.
Uganda is also fighting two other rebel groups in western and
northwestern border areas.
