   The Russian mafia is using profits from kidnapping and drug trafficking in 
Latin America to fund its arms-running activities, Ecuadoran police said <TIMEX2 val="1999-05-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>. 

A wing of the Russian mafia is active in Colombia and is warehousing drugs in 
Ecuador for export to Europe in order to fund its kidnapping and arms 
trafficking activities, according to Ecuadoran intelligence reports. 

The police Kidnapping Unit had received several reports of Eastern European 
citizens who had been abducted in <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-05" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="anchor could be 'ending'; the text is not explicit about whether it is _all_ recent months.">recent months</TIMEX2> in the country, the Kidnapping 
and Extortion Unit said. 

In one case a <TIMEX2 val="P19Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-04" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">19-year-old</TIMEX2> Ukrainian, Tatiana Maksimova, was kidnapped during a 
visit to Quito <TIMEX2 val="1999-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="'last april' seems an odd way to refer to 'last month'. Could it be 13 months ago - 1998-04?">last April</TIMEX2>. 

The kidnapper was fellow Russian Alexandra Bezusoca, who originally posed as a 
friend, but later asked Maksimova's parents for a ransom of 200 million sucres 
(2,000 dollars). 

Maksimova's family, however, went to the Ukrainian embassy which called in the 
Ecuadoran police. The hostage was freed on <TIMEX2 val="1999-05-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May 1</TIMEX2>, and Bezusoca fled the country. 

The intelligence report also notes that Ecuador's Russian community has not 
provided any information to help the police with their investigations into the 
mafia connection.
