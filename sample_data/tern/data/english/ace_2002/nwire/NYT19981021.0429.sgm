WYE MILLS, Md. _ As Middle East peace talks dragged late into
the night of the seventh day on Wednesday, the Israeli side
threatened to walk out and go home, demanding changes in a draft
agreement on security approved by both the Palestinians and the
Americans.
Over the last seven days, the Americans, Israelis and
Palestinians have been working to produce a final, agreed text of
some 20 pages that lays out the phased exchange of 13 percent of
West Bank land over 12 weeks in return for specific Palestinian
actions to fight terrorism.
After meeting late on Wednesday afternoon with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to go over an American document spelling
out the terms of an agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel issued a a statement saying that there ``can be no
agreement'' unless ``substantial progess'' was made on two issues _
a commitment by the Palestine National Council to publicly change
its charter and renounce its call for the destruction of the state
of Israel and a deal to extradite Palestinians wanted for allegedly
attacking Israelis.
Arafat has said that the Palestine national charter has been
stripped of its clauses demanding the destruction of Israel, but
Israelis complain the amended charter has never been published.
Arafat has offered to have an amended charter approved by the
smaller Palestine Executive Council of the National Council, but
the Israelis insist that the whole National Council meet for a
public vote within three months.
On extradition _ which the Israelis call ``transfer'' in order
not to prematurely recognize the Palestinian Authority as a legal
state _ Netanyahu wants some 36 individuals handed over to Israel
for trial. Israel charges them with involvement in attacks against
Israelis, and at least some of them serve in the Palestinian
police.
The Americans believe they have worked out a satisfactory
compromise. Under this plan, the CIA, which sits on a security
committee with Palestinian and Israeli security chiefs, will vet
the Israeli cases and decide which Palestinians should be jailed
and tried, but in Palestinian courts. The Israelis apparently find
this compromise unacceptable.
The Israelis also say they want firm Palestinian commitments to
reduce the number of Palestinian police to numbers laid out in the
Oslo accords and to confiscate unregistered, illegal weapons. The
Americans believe those issues are also essentially settled.
An agreement is also supposed to include the immediate
resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks on a final peace settlement
_ which is supposed to be complete by May 4, 1999, when the Oslo
process that governs the relations between Israel and the
Palestinians runs out.
Even while Albright and Netanyahu were meeting late on Wednesday
afternoon, Israeli officials were busily and visibly bringing
packed suitcases out on to the lawn.
A senior American official said the Israeli drama was crude and
that Albright was ``bemused'' by the display. But it was a dramatic
example of the brinksmanship American officials expected during the
end game of these tortuous negotiations.
``My betting is that will turn out to be a childish ploy,'' the
official said. ``I wouldn't think their private posture is quite as
stark as their public posture.''
American officials made it clear that in their view the
Palestinians had done enough to keep these talks going, and that
the Americans would put the onus for any failure on the Israelis.
