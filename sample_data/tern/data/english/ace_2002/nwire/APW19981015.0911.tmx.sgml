VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Australia's second-seed Patrick Rafter
moved into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP
tournament <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> by ousting Magnus Norman of Sweden 6-3, 6-2.
``I match up well with someone like Magnus,'' Rafter said after
his victory.
Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, has a chance of replacing Pete
Sampras as the top-ranked player in the world in <TIMEX2 val="PXW" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-W42" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">the coming weeks</TIMEX2>.
One step in this direction could be <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>'s quarterfinal
encounter with Britain's Greg Rusedski, whose powerful serve
stunned local darling Thomas Muster, who is a far cry from his
<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-15T16:36" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">onetime</TIMEX2> prowess.
Rafter, who has a 5-1 head-to-head record against Rusedski,
said, ``I never played Greg on this surface, and I do not know how
I will react to his serve.
``But I am confident there will be a couple of breaks here and
there,'' he added.
Rusedski, <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>'s finalist at the Vienna tournament, took <TIMEX2 val="PT64M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="I dont know when this game occurred. Last year?">64
minutes</TIMEX2> to defeat Muster in straight sets 6-4, 6-3.
``It's always difficult to play Thomas in Austria,'' said the
Briton afterward. ``But I am very pleased that they did not let the
crowd getting into it.''
Asked what his chance was to qualify for the World Championship
in Hanover, Germany, Rusedski said, ``I think I still have a slight
chance, but the other guys in the top eight have solidified their
position.''
Earlier in <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2>, Todd Martin of the United States downed
fourth-seed Petr Korda of the Czech Republic.
Opening <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a day of second-round matches</TIMEX2>, the unseeded American
beat favored Korda 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
Fifth-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia then defeated Germany's
Tommy Haas 7-5, 6-4.
Haas' main problem was his weakness with the first service.
Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden subsequently subdued Bohdan Ulihrach of
the Czech Republic, 6-4, 6-1.
In the last singles of <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the day</TIMEX2>, eight-seed Tim Henman of Britain
fought back after being one set down to oust Swden's Thomas Enqvist
6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-3.
