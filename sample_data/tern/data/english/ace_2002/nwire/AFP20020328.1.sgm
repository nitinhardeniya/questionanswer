Russia planing to counter US missile shield: defence minister Russia
is preparing "technical and scientific" measures to counter a planned
US missile defence shield, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov
said.  "I want to underline that the US shield does not yet exist, and
so it is difficult to speak of retaliatory measures," Ivanov was
quoted as saying by ITAR-TASS during a visit to a military base.

"But this is not to say that we are not thinking about or taking
technical and scientific measures," he added.

"We are going to do everything to counter these threats when they take
shape, if they ever take shape, which is to say not before 2015-2020,"
Ivanov said.  The defence minister said Russia's strategic forces were
the "basis for the effectiveness of our army," which is due to undergo
a thorough modernisation over the next 15 years.

The United States has officially given notice of its intention to
withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, which
outlaws missile defence systems, citing the threat posed by so-called
"rogue states" such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq.

The United States has so far carried out six tests, four of which have
been successful, as part of its controversial plan to deploy an
anti-missile system.
