    Gunmen fired at a car bearing the son of murdered lawmaker and businessman 
Yevhen Shcherban, who was shot dead last year in a killing that shocked Ukraine, 
relatives and associates said Tuesday. 

The son, who is also named Yevhan, escaped injury in Monday's attack but a 
bodyguard and driver were wounded. Family and colleagues described the incident 
in the southeastern city of Donetsk as an attempt on the son's life. 

''We are always being tailed. We are constantly being threatened,'' another son, 
Ruslan Shcherban, told a news conference in Kiev, according to the Interfax news 
agency. 

The senior Shcherban was a businessman believed to be one of the richest men in 
Ukraine, and a leader of a political party in parliament. He was gunned down 
last November as he stepped off a plane at the airport in Donetsk. His wife was 
also killed. 

According to Interfax, Shcherban's three sons took over his company after the 
death of their parents. Shcherban had holdings in coal, steel, construction, 
real estate, agriculture, gas and other enterprises. 

At the time of his death, Ukrainian newspapers linked Shcherban to a failed 
assassination attempt on Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko in July 1996, a charge 
the lawmaker repeatedly denied.
