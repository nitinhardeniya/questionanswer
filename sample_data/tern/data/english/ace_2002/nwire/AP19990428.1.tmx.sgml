    Two young Georgians were sentenced to life in prison <TIMEX2 val="1999-04-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, for 
murdering a <TIMEX2 val="P50Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">50-year-old</TIMEX2> Georgian businessman known as the ''godfather'' of 
Georgian criminal empire. 

After <TIMEX2 val="PT11H" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-04-28" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">nearly 11 hours of deliberation</TIMEX2> an Austrian jury sentenced Akaki 
Javakhadze, 22, and Georgi Oniani, 23, each to life in prison for <TIMEX2 val="1996" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1996</TIMEX2> murder of 
David Sanikidze. 

A third man, Schukri Burtschuladze, 23, was sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="it's unclear when this 20 year duratio starts due to 'time served' allowences">20 years in prison</TIMEX2> for 
accessory to murder. 

On <TIMEX2 val="1996-07-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">July 11, 1996</TIMEX2>, David Sanikidze was shot dead as he strolled through Vienna's 
downtown area with a woman companion, who was seriously injured. 

<TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-07-11" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="vague offset from July 11, 1996">A few days later</TIMEX2>, Javakhadze and Oniani, were arrested in Budapest, Hungary, and 
charged with the murder. Burtschuladze was later arrested and charged. All three 
pleaded innocent. 

Sanikidze, who was involved in hotel construction projects in Russia and 
Georgia, was also a major figure in a criminal syndicate active in extortion and 
protection rackets the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-04-28" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Soviet republic, prosecutors say. 

Investigators have speculated the killing was linked to illegal business deals 
among Georgian criminal gangs. 

The trial lasted <TIMEX2 val="P8M" mod="LESS_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-04" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">nearly eight months</TIMEX2>.
