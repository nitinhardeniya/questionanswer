    Two young Georgians were sentenced to life in prison Wednesday, for 
murdering a 50-year-old Georgian businessman known as the ''godfather'' of 
Georgian criminal empire. 

After nearly 11 hours of deliberation an Austrian jury sentenced Akaki 
Javakhadze, 22, and Georgi Oniani, 23, each to life in prison for 1996 murder of 
David Sanikidze. 

A third man, Schukri Burtschuladze, 23, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for 
accessory to murder. 

On July 11, 1996, David Sanikidze was shot dead as he strolled through Vienna's 
downtown area with a woman companion, who was seriously injured. 

A few days later, Javakhadze and Oniani, were arrested in Budapest, Hungary, and 
charged with the murder. Burtschuladze was later arrested and charged. All three 
pleaded innocent. 

Sanikidze, who was involved in hotel construction projects in Russia and 
Georgia, was also a major figure in a criminal syndicate active in extortion and 
protection rackets the former Soviet republic, prosecutors say. 

Investigators have speculated the killing was linked to illegal business deals 
among Georgian criminal gangs. 

The trial lasted nearly eight months.
