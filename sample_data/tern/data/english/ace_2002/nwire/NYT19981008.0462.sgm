NEW YORK _ All but one of 36 lymph nodes taken from Darryl
Strawberry were free of cancer, his doctors at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan reported
Thursday, and they said the Yankee outfielder could be released
from the hospital on Sunday.
In a statement released through the hospital, doctors presented
an optimistic report on his condition and predicted he would ``make
a complete recovery and return to full activities including playing
major league baseball next season.''
Colon cancer was diagnosed for Strawberry, 36, on Oct. 1, and he
had surgery two days later to remove a tumor and a 16-inch portion
of his large intestine.
According to the statement, one lymph node contained evidence of
tumor. The margins of the colon, doctors said, were free of
disease. They said Strawberry would require a ``course of adjuvant
chemotherapy,'' meaning he would be administered drugs to help
prevent a recurrence of the cancer. There was no mention whether he
would need radiation treatment.
In a statement released through the team, Strawberry said: ``I
am really feeling stronger every day, and I'm truly grateful to all
of my doctors. They feel very good about everything and are
confident this will be a successful process. When you are in a
situation like this, you put yourself in your doctors' hands. I
share their confidence.''
David Cone, the Yankees' pitcher and a longtime teammate of
Strawberry with the Mets and Yankees, said: ``It looks good. We all
anticipated some chemo _ to what extent, we didn't know. It seems
like good news right now.''
