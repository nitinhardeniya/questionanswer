Alexander Volkovsky, president of the Russo-Balt Petroleum company,
was shot several times in the chest in the entranceway to his
apartment building on <TIMEX2 val="2001-01-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, said prosecutor's office spokesman

Police found a discarded magazine from a pistol at the scene, but
announced no other leads.

The killing resembled the scores of contract murders committed <TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">every

organized crime groups can lead to the murders.
