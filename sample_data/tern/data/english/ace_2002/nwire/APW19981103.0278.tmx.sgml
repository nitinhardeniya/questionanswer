COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ A Chilean exile has filed a complaint
against <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-03T06:33" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet accusing him
of responsibility for her arrest and torture in Chile in <TIMEX2 val="1973" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1973</TIMEX2>,
prosecutors said <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>.
The woman, a Chilean who has since gained German citizenship,
accused Pinochet of depriving her of personal liberty and causing
bodily harm during her arrest and torture.
Prosecutors were determining whether Germany has jurisdiction in
the case since the woman was not a German citizen at <TIMEX2 val="1973" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="sometime in 1973">the time of
her arrest and torture</TIMEX2>, and also whether the charges were still
valid <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored - pragmatically present reference">25 years after the fact</TIMEX2>, spokeswoman Regine Appenrodt said.
The legal action was the latest by Chilean exiles who claim to
have suffered under Pinochet's <TIMEX2 val="P17Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">17-year</TIMEX2> rule since Britain's High
Court ruled illegal the dictator's arrest in London on a Spanish
warrant seeking his extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping
and torture.
Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, is expected to rule
<TIMEX2 val="1998-W45" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2> on an appeal to the High Court ruling that Pinochet is
immune from prosecution as a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-03T06:33" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> head of state.
But, meanwhile, Chilean exiles in Belgium, Norway, Switzerland
and France have independently filed similar complaints seeking
Pinochet's prosecution or extradition.
A report by Chile's democratically elected government says more
than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's
rule.
