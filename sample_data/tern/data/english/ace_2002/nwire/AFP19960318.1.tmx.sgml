   A powerful explosive device was found in a bus here <TIMEX2 val="1996-03-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> and was 
defused <TIMEX2 val="1996-03-17TXX:XX" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored">only 15 minutes before it was timed to go off</TIMEX2>, Interfax news 
agency reported <TIMEX2 val="1996-03-18" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, citing the Interior Ministry. 

The defusing of a bomb <TIMEX2 val="1996-03-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2> in a Moscow bus came against a backdrop of 
increasing violence in the Russian capital. 

Overall, crime rose six percent <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> over <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1994</TIMEX2>. Most crimes have 
economic underpinnings as crime gangs settle scores or carry out violent 
robberies. Acts of political terrorism remain rare. 

Bombings in particular on the increase. According to the latest available 
statistics, they rose to 545 in <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1993</TIMEX2> -- killing 83 people -- from 185 in 
<TIMEX2 val="1992" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1992</TIMEX2>. 

Bombs and bomb-making materials remain relatively easy to steal or buy 
from poorly guarded military warehouses, authorities say. 

On <TIMEX2 val="1995-12-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December 5</TIMEX2>, a bomb was found in the parliamentary office of an 
extreme-right deputy, Nikolai Lysenko. There were no casualities. 

On <TIMEX2 val="1995-10-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October 14</TIMEX2>, one man took hostage some 30 South Korean tourists in a bus 
just outside the Kremlin, demanding a million dollars. After <TIMEX2 val="PT9H" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1995-10-14" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">nine hours</TIMEX2>, 
troops stormed the bus, killed the gunman and freed the hostages unharmed. 

On <TIMEX2 val="1995-09-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September 13</TIMEX2>, a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the US embassy in 
downtown Moscow, causing damage but no casualties. No one claimed 
responsibility. 

On <TIMEX2 val="1995-03-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">March 1</TIMEX2>, the top news presenter on ORT national television, Vladislav 
Lystiyev, was shot dead in the entrance to his apartment building. The 
murderer has never been found, but police believe the shooting was linked 
to Lystiyev's plans to temporarily suspend ORT's advertising. 

In <TIMEX2 val="1994-11" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">November 1994</TIMEX2>, a bomb exploded at the entrance of a residential 
building, killing Mikhail Likhodei, president of an association of Soviet 
Afghan war veterans, and injuring three others. 

But the bombing that most shocked Russia was the one that killed Dimitri 
Kholodov, a young investigative reporter for the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">daily</TIMEX2> Moskovski 
Komsomolets, on <TIMEX2 val="1994-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">October 17, 1994</TIMEX2> -- just as he was preparing to publish 
the latest in his revelations on corruption at the highest level of the 
military. 

The newspaper alleged that the murder was linked to Kholodov's 
investigations. His funeral drew thousands of mourners. 

Some bombings have had less obvious motives. In <TIMEX2 val="1992-09-13" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September 13, 1992</TIMEX2>, a 
grenade was tossed into the queue at Moscow's main McDonald's restaurant 
on Pushkin Square, injuring eight people.
