SAN FRANCISCO _ Two weeks ago, Renada Daniel Patterson's only
kidney, donated by her father, began to fail, prompting a swirling
debate when he offered to give her his remaining one.
But on Friday, even as the medical ethics committee at the
University of California-San Francisco Medical Center was
discussing whether to allow a transplant that would make David
Patterson a dialysis patient for the rest of his life, his
16-year-old daughter and her mother announced that the debate was
moot: Renada had been healed by God.
``Renada is healthy now,'' said her mother, Vickie Daniel.
``She's happy and well.''
But Renada's pediatric nephrologist, Dr. Donald Potter, has a
more sober prognosis. While medication has stabilized Renada's
condition, Potter does not believe she is cured, Janet Basu, a
spokeswoman for the medical center, said.
``When Renada entered the hospital on December 2, her condition
was good,'' Ms. Basu said. ``She was released on December 6 after
treatment to prevent rejection. The results so far have been
encouraging.
``This is not a cure, Ms. Basu said. ``It doesn't mean that she
won't need a transplant sometime in the future. The same condition
exists as two weeks ago. She didn't need a transplant; she didn't
need dialysis. But sometime in the future, she will need these
things.''
Mrs. Daniel had pushed hard for her daughter's right to take her
father's last kidney. Patterson, an inmate at California State
Prison in Sacramento who abandoned Renada when she was a baby, was
offering her the best gift a father could, Mrs. Daniel had said.
Besides, she said, ``we don't know how much time Renada's got
left.''
Now, she said, it seems as if Renada is fine. At a news
conference on Friday at the hospital, the University of
California-San Francisco Stanford Health Care, where she made her
stunning announcement, she said that blood tests showed that
Renada's kidney appeared to be functioning normally, and that her
doctor said she would not be needing a transplant or dialysis.
The family's pastor, the Rev. Lorenzo Carlisle of the Oakland
United Church of Christ, called it ``a supernatural phenomenon, a
gift that God has given us for the world to see.''
Renada was born with one kidney, which failed when she was 5.
Her body rejected a transplant a year later, and for seven years
she was a dialysis patient. Then, three years ago, her father, who
had not been in touch for years, called from prison to offer her
one of his kidneys. The transplant worked until Renada stopped
taking her anti-rejection medication because it bloated her, caused
a hump in her back and made her feel ill.
At the university medical center, the ethics committee has been
saddled with the unprecedented situation of authorizing a
transplant that would appear to violate the Hippocratic oath that
requires doctors to ``first, do no harm'' to patients.
Dr. Wade Smith, the chairman of the ethics committee, said on
Friday that the committee was pleased to hear from Mrs. Daniel that
Renada was doing well, but that the committee would continue its
discussions, and would meet in January more than once before making
a recommendation.

</ANNOTATION>
Medical scholars nationwide have been divided over the ethics of
accepting Patterson's offer for another transplant. Some are
categorically against it; others say it depends on how it would
affect Patterson's life. There is also debate over whether
Patterson's status as an inmate should be considered, since he
would still be an inmate if the transplant occurred before 2003.
Patterson, 38, is serving time for burglary and drug
convictions. (In 1997, his original sentence of seven years for
burglary was lengthened by five years after he was found with
heroin in his cell.)
In the two weeks since Mrs. Daniel first held a news conference
admonishing the hospital, University of California-San Francisco
Stanford Health Care, for even debating the transplant issue, she
has been criticized on radio and television talk shows for
insisting that the transplant be allowed.
