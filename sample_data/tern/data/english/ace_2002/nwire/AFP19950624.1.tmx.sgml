   Norwegian police have exposed Russian mafia plans for terrorist actions 
against Norway in a bid to blackmail the country for money, the Norwegian daily 
VG said <TIMEX2 val="1995-06-24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>. 

The detailed plans were revealed before the plans could be set in motion, 
terrorism expert and Interpol FBI investigator Robert A. Sutton told VG. 

The head of the Norwegian secret police, Hans Olav Oestgaard, confirmed that the 
secret police had received and registered information from foreign colleagues 
regarding the threats. 

The mafia intended to use radioactive materials to contaminate drinking water, 
but the plans never made it to Norwegian soil before they were exposed, 
Oestgaard said.
