HEADLINE: Russian mafia using Pacific region as money laundering base: OECD 
DATELINE: PARIS, Feb 11

<TEXT>
   Russian organised crime is increasingly using the Pacific region as a base 
for laundering its ill-gotten gains, the OECD's Financial Action Task Force 
(FATF) said Thursday. 

"A heavyuru, Vanuatu and the Cook Islands," the FATF said in an annual report on 
money laundering. 

It cited "an increasingly common scheme whereby apparently American middlemen 
are used to open accounts or charter banks in one of the locations" to hide the 
Russian origin of the money after local authorities became suspicious at the 
high level of Russian activity in the region. 

The Russian mafia are also looking for "potential alliances" with drug 
traffickers in Central and South America and the Caribbean, which remains a 
"significant problem" area for money laundering. 

There is also concern over the rise in Internet gambling, which generates nearly 
1.5 million dollars a month in the Pacific region and is seen as "another 
potential vulnerability for money laundering and financial crime." 

Such electronic casinos offer clients virtual anonymity, making the source of 
their cash all the harder to trace. 

Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, the report said, the principal sources of 
criminal funds are human trafficking, drug trafficking, gambling and organised 
crime. 

South Asia is a particular focus for money laundering activities as it is home 
to several major international banks as well as being a transshipment point for 
drugs from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. 

In South Asia, money laundering through gold transactions is particularly 
popular, either through a gold dealer who provides gold in exchange for cash and 
cheques received by the presenter, or through a cash transaction in one country 
which is completed by a gold deposit to the owner in another country. 

But as elsewhere in the world, electronic payment transactions are also a cause 
for concern, along with the increasing use of accountants and lawyers to help 
set up and manage accounts set up to launder the proceeds of criminal activity. 

A key problem is the fact that few Asia-Pacific countries are members of the 
FATF, with the exceptions of Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. 

But the region has set up an Asia/Pacific Group to battle money laundering, 
which held its first fully-fledged meeting in October grouping exports from 25 
countries and is to meet annually, with the next meeting due in Tokyo in March. 

The FATF is based at the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development in 
Paris and groups 24 of the 29 OECD members plus the European Commission, the 
Gulf Cooperation Council, and non-OECD members Singapore and Hong Kong.
