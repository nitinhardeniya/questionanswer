PARIS (AP) _ Pig farmers blocked roads and held noisy rallies
across France Friday to protest plunging prices and to demand rapid
distribution of government aid.
Four thousand farmers rallied in the city of Rennes, Britanny. A
delegation of pork producers was to meet with local authorities.
A rally was also being held in Bailleul, northern France, where
dozens of farmers at midday set tires and haystacks on fire. Other
rallies were planned in Montauban and Lyon.
In northern France, traffic was snarled on a major highway after
farmers deliberately drove slowly and blocked access roads between
Dunkirk and Lille.
Farmers have been squeezed for months by the price of pork,
which was selling Friday at 5.18 francs (95 cents) a kilo (2.2
pounds), about 4 francs (70 cents) below production costs. They say
they can't cover their costs with such low prices, caused by
falling demand and overproduction.
The French government said Tuesday it would provide 150 million
francs (dlrs 27 million) in extra aid to the producers. The farmers
said Friday they would not tolerate any delay.
``Since the end of 1997 I've been losing money,'' said Pierre
Hughes, a pig farmer from Fletres. ``I had put some money aside,
but if this continues the banks will cut off my allowance.''
