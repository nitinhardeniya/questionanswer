Vienna ex-mayor to visit Havel, discuss allegations of spying
</HEADLINE>

PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The ex mayor of Vienna is expected
to meet next week with President Vaclav Havel to discuss
allegations of the Austrian's collaboration with the police under
the past communist regime, the daily Pravo reported Friday.
According to Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek, Havel issued the
invitation to former Mayor Helmut Zilk Thursday, but no specific
date was announced.
Zilk was rejected for a Czech Republic medal of honor just three
days before the official ceremony on Oct 28, because of sudden
allegations that he was an informant for police in communist
Czechoslovakia.
Havel's office then cited newspaper reports and other
unspecified information supposedly confirming the allegations. By
law, Havel has no official access to the communist police files.
Zilk, 71, denied the allegations as ``absolute nonsense''.
According to Spacek, Havel was briefed Thursday on the contents
of Zilk's file by Interior minister Vaclav Grulich and archive
manager Jan Frolik.
