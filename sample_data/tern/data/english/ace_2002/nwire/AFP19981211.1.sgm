Geneva, <STORY_REF_TIME>Dec 11</STORY_REF_TIME> (AFP) -- Alleged 
Russian mafia chief Sergei Mikhailov was acquitted Friday [11 December] 
following a trial here in Switzerland. The prosecution had demanded the maximum 
sentence of seven and a half years in prison for Mikhailov to shelter Western 
democracies from the "gangrene" of organized crime. Mikkailov had been charged 
with belonging to a criminal group, falsifing documents and breaking the law on 
property acquisitions by foreigners in Switzerland.
