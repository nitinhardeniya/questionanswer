KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ International donor countries said
Thursday they are releasing funds to support Uganda's three-year
development program after receiving assurances that the government
will fight corruption and limit its defense expenditure to planned
budget allocations.
A statement read to reporters said nearly dlrs 2.2 billion will
be committed to Uganda through 2001.
Dlrs 830 million of the amount will be budget support for the
1998-99 fiscal year, the statement said.
A World Bank-led consultative group of donor nations and
multi-lateral lending agencies has been holding discussions in
Kampala since Monday.
Representatives of donor countries and lending agencies have
expressed concern about corruption and defense spending, but
according to the document, they are satisfied with commitment
expressed to address the two issues.
``We came to the meeting concerned about corruption, attended
the meetings concerned and are leaving the meeting concerned but
convinced that the government has a time-bound program to fight
corruption,'' said World Bank director for Uganda and Tanzania
James Adams, who chaired the meeting.
``Donors have become increasingly concerned that in many sectors
and at different levels of society, corruption remained a serious
problem that required urgent action. A number of projects have been
undermined by lack of financial discipline and weak procurement
practices,'' the donors' statement said.
On Thursday, President Yoweri Museveni, embarrassed by rampant
cases of corruption in which millions of dollars in donor funds
have disappeared in the hands of implementing officials _
particularly in the agriculture sector _ said he would fight
corruption to the extent of hiring foreign experts, including
judges.
Donor representatives reportedly expressed concern that Uganda's
involvement in the conflict in neighboring Congo could push defense
spending over budgeted limits.
``While recognizing the regional and internal security issues
that confront Uganda, donors saw a risk that pressures for higher
defense spending could undermine Uganda's record of micro-economic
stability or divert government resources from priority expenditures
in education, health, roads and agricultural extension,'' the
statement said.
Uganda, which has been receiving aid to support more than 50
percent of its annual budget, has had an average growth rate of 6.2
percent over the past several years.
