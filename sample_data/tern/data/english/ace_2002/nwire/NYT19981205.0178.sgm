NEW YORK _ Dr. Peter Diamandopoulos, who was forced out as
president of Adelphi University last year over issues of excessive
compensation and mismanagement, has been hired as a special
assistant to the president of Boston University.
The move reunites Diamandopoulos with his mentor, Dr. John
Silber, the chancellor of Boston University. The two were friendly
competitors for the rank as the nation's highest-paid college or
university chief, although Boston University's enrollment of 30,000
is several times as big as Adelphi's, which is 4,275.
Silber served on Adelphi's Board of Trustees until the board was
removed from office by the New York State Board of Regents last
year for failing to properly oversee Diamandopoulos and the
university. A new board appointed by the regents then terminated
Diamandopoulos' contract as president.
At the formal hearings leading up to the regents' decision,
Silber was a staunch defender of Diamandopoulos, his compensation
and his policies.
Diamandopoulos' new appointment was first reported by the
student newspaper at Boston University. A university spokesman,
Colin Riley, said Saturday that Diamandopoulos would serve as a
special assistant to President Jon Westling, handling special
projects in development, international education and educational
policy. Diamandopoulos' new salary was not disclosed.
At Adelphi, Diamandopoulos was criticized for not raising much
endowment money and resorting instead to large tuition increases,
which helped cause the enrollment to plunge 62 percent during his
12 years as president. He did promote foreign student programs,
especially in his native Greece. His education policies often
caused conflict with the faculty, but he was credited with creating
Adelphi's honors college, which has continued after his departure.
To settle a tangle of litigation in the aftermath of
Diamandopoulos' removal from Adelphi, he, Silber and the other
former trustees agreed to repay Adelphi more than $1 million for
some of the excessive compensation and legal fees. In addition,
Diamandopoulos had to return $740,000, although he was granted a
partial settlement for the cancellation of his five-year contract.
