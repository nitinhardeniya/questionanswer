Development Programs Harmful for Global Strategic Balance and 
Stability

China has expressed "serious concern" over a massive missile
development program of the United States on January 13, describing it
as "going against the tide of times and being harmful to the global
arms control efforts."  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
made the remarks in response to a report at a regular press conference
on January 13 that the Clinton administration required US congress to
allocate additional 2.2 billion US dollars for the development of
National Missile Defense system (NMD).  United States, already a
country with the world's largest nuclear and conventional weaponry,
should have again put great efforts to develop NMD and Theater Missile
Defense system (TMD) in the beginning of the new century, Zhu said.

"Such move goes against the tide of our times and is detrimental to
the global efforts of arms control and disarmament,' he said, adding
it will have an extensive and deep adverse impact on the international
and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century.

He stressed that China believed that the development, deployment and
transfer of any anti-missile systems with strategic defense potentials
will not enhance security or curb missile technology proliferation but
will eventually undermine security and instigate missile technology
proliferation. "It should be the noted that US's move has violated the
Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems (ABM)," he
stressed.

The spokesman said that ABM, a document significant for maintaining
global strategic balance and stability and the nuclear disarmament
process, should be strictly observed.

Zhu also called for efforts of the international community to
safeguard ABM.  On December 1, 1999, he said, the 54th United Nations
General Assembly passed a resolution jointly submitted by Russia,
China and Belarus on the maintenance and adherence of ABM.The
resolution, passed with votes of overwhelming majority, demonstrated
the any move by any country to revise ABM or develop anti-missile
systems will surely be opposed.

"We urged relevant countries to seriously consider the strong call
from the international community and abandon the above-mentioned
anti-missile development programs," he said.
