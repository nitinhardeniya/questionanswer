ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister held talks with
Turkish officials in Ankara Friday in a bid to defuse a mounting
crisis between Turkey and Syria over Kurdish rebels.
Turkey issued an ultimatum to Syria this week, demanding that
Damascus expel Turkish Kurdish rebels from its territory or ``face
the consequences.''
Turkish reports suggested air strikes on suspected rebel bases
in the Syrian controlled-Bekaa Valley of Lebanon were possible.
Syria denies the accusations. Turkey's warlike rhetoric has
raised fears of a regional conflict.
Later on Friday, Turkey's chief of general staff, president,
prime minister and foreign minister were scheduled to meet on the
crisis.
Syria's Kamal Kharrazi held talks with his Turkish counterpart
Ismail Cem and President Suleyman Demirel.
``If everything goes right, there may soon be a peaceful
settlement of the situation,'' Kharrazi told reporters after having
a lunch with Cem. ``But it is early to speculate on that.''
On Thursday, Kharrazi discussed the problem with Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus.
Private NTV television said on Friday that Kharrazi could be
bringing a message from Assad.
Kharrazi said in Ankara that ``the important thing is to search
for a peaceful solution to the crisis. It is the wish of all Muslim
countries.''
Iran entered mediation efforts in its role as the head of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, a 55-member group that
includes Syria and Turkey. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also
shuttled between the two countries earlier this week.
But Turkey has accused Iran of also turning a blind eye to the
Kurdish rebel presence on its territory along the Turkish border.
``The rebels enter Iranian territory from northern Iraq and
stage cross-border attacks from there,'' Deputy Premier Bulent
Ecevit told reporters on Thursday.
Cem thanked Iran for its ``brotherly efforts.''
Turkish authorities have made clear their preference for a
diplomatic solution, but Premier Mesut Yilmaz said ending the
tension was up to Syria.
Relations between Syria and Turkey have always been troublesome.
Syria is concerned by Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates
River _ a main source of water for Syria. The recent boost in
Israeli-Turkish military and diplomatic relations has also angered
Damascus, and several Arab countries.
The Turkish-Kurdish war has claimed some 37,000 lives since
1984.
Ankara has asked Syria to extradite rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, who resides in Damascus according to Turkish intelligence
reports. Turkey also wants Syria to put an end to its support to
the rebels, who are fighting for autonomy within Turkey.
