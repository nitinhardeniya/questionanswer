   Thousands of mourners in this eastern Ukrainian city on <TIMEX2 val="1995-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> attended the 
funeral of their home soccer club's president and alleged mafia boss. 

Alexander Bragin, an ethnic Tatar known locally as ''Alik the Greek,'' died <TIMEX2 val="1995-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last 
Sunday</TIMEX2> after a remote-controlled bomb exploded near his seating area at the 
Donetsk stadium during a soccer match. 

The blast also killed four of Bragin's bodyguards and his cousin. 

Police have readily described the slain man as a top Donetsk organized crime 
boss and said the spectacular assassination was likely part of fighting between 
rival crime gangs. 

''This is a battle on the grounds of dividing (city) territory,'' Yuri Udavtsov, 
an official with the local public prosecutor's office, told The Associated 
Press. 

''However, officially Bragin is not a criminal,'' he added, pointing out that 
the victim was never found guilty of any serious crimes by a court of law. 

Heavy police protection surrounded <TIMEX2 val="1995-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2>'s burials of Bragin and his cousin at 
a Donetsk cemetery. Police helicopters hovered above the crowd of about 3,000 
mourners, many of whom arrived in expensive foreign cars. 

The country's Muslim Mufti came from Kiev to conduct the service for the two 
slain Tatars. 

Police already have formed a special task force to investigate the blast. But 
they say Bragin's colleagues probably know whom to blame. 

''I think that (they) know who was involved in this explosion but they will want 
to deal with it themselves,'' said Donetsk Police Chief Arkady Boldovsky. 

Bragin was considered one of Donetsk's richest businessmen. 

In addition to presiding over the local Shakhtyor soccer club, he also headed 
the Lux company which owned two of the city's hotels, 40 percent of a local toy 
factory, and a network of city stores, reported the Interfax news agency. 

It was also reportedly the fourth assassination attempt on Bragin, who regularly 
traveled around Donetsk in one of his three armored Mercedes cars. One attack 
<TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2> resulted in the deaths of two of his bodyguards and a bystander.
