   A powerful explosive device was found in a bus here Sunday and was 
defused only 15 minutes before it was timed to go off, Interfax news 
agency reported Monday, citing the Interior Ministry. 

The defusing of a bomb Sunday in a Moscow bus came against a backdrop of 
increasing violence in the Russian capital. 

Overall, crime rose six percent last year over 1994. Most crimes have 
economic underpinnings as crime gangs settle scores or carry out violent 
robberies. Acts of political terrorism remain rare. 

Bombings in particular on the increase. According to the latest available 
statistics, they rose to 545 in 1993 -- killing 83 people -- from 185 in 
1992. 

Bombs and bomb-making materials remain relatively easy to steal or buy 
from poorly guarded military warehouses, authorities say. 

On December 5, a bomb was found in the parliamentary office of an 
extreme-right deputy, Nikolai Lysenko. There were no casualities. 

On October 14, one man took hostage some 30 South Korean tourists in a bus 
just outside the Kremlin, demanding a million dollars. After nine hours, 
troops stormed the bus, killed the gunman and freed the hostages unharmed. 

On September 13, a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the US embassy in 
downtown Moscow, causing damage but no casualties. No one claimed 
responsibility. 

On March 1, the top news presenter on ORT national television, Vladislav 
Lystiyev, was shot dead in the entrance to his apartment building. The 
murderer has never been found, but police believe the shooting was linked 
to Lystiyev's plans to temporarily suspend ORT's advertising. 

In November 1994, a bomb exploded at the entrance of a residential 
building, killing Mikhail Likhodei, president of an association of Soviet 
Afghan war veterans, and injuring three others. 

But the bombing that most shocked Russia was the one that killed Dimitri 
Kholodov, a young investigative reporter for the daily Moskovski 
Komsomolets, on October 17, 1994 -- just as he was preparing to publish 
the latest in his revelations on corruption at the highest level of the 
military. 

The newspaper alleged that the murder was linked to Kholodov's 
investigations. His funeral drew thousands of mourners. 

Some bombings have had less obvious motives. In September 13, 1992, a 
grenade was tossed into the queue at Moscow's main McDonald's restaurant 
on Pushkin Square, injuring eight people.
