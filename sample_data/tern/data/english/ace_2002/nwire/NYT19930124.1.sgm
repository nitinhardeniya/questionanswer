   Viktor Nakhimovitch Ternyak, an investment broker in the Russian city of 
Yekaterinburg, slid into the passenger seat of his white Volvo shortly before 9 
A.M. on Sept. 8, 1992. He nodded curtly to his driver and settled back for his 
ride to work. 

As the car emerged from the driveway of his apartment building, a man fired 
seven shots from a Makarov pistol through the car windows, and vanished. Ternyak 
died instantly. His driver and a bodyguard were wounded. 

The murder of the 57-year-old millionaire evoked both shock and resignation in 
this city of 1.5 million people, one of the country's most important industrial 
and political centers. The fourth Yekaterinburg citizen gunned down in a 
six-month period, Ternyak was a member of a remarkable group of 
bureaucrats-turned-entrepreneurs who proved there was life after Communism. 

The heavyset businessman began his career as a waiter, rising eventually to 
become manager of a group of state restaurants, a position that under the Soviet 
system was often associated with black-market profits. Over the last two years, 
with the country moving toward free enterprise, he built a prosperous 
conglomerate of investment houses and insurance companies. The success of his 
Euro-Asiatic Company won him a seat on the London Metal Exchange. He had become 
a major contributor to town charities. A few weeks before he was killed, Ternyak 
announced plans to introduce the city's first credit-card system. 

Although they still have no suspects, the police say they believe that Ternyak 
was murdered because his wealth and influence threatened Yekaterinburg "mafiya" 
organizations. "His company was getting too strong," says Maj. Vladimir Koltsov, 
a senior investigator in the local branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
who adds that Ternyak might have angered some of his former black-market 
associates. "He was beginning to move away from the influence of some of the 
groups." 

Dozens witnessed the Ternyak shooting, but no one stepped forward to give the 
police a description of the gunman. "The people who ordered Ternyak's death, and 
paid for it, knew they had nothing to fear from witnesses or authorities," 
Koltsov says angrily. "Shooting someone like Ternyak, in broad daylight, means 
we've got to the point where they don't even bother to cover up their traces 
anymore." 

For the first time in the memory of many Yekaterinburgers, gang violence is no 
longer something that happens in distant capitalist countries. The past year has 
seen car hijackings, explosions, kidnappings, mysterious fires and shootouts. 
During an evening's stroll last summer on one of the city's main boulevards, a 
pedestrian saw two cars screech to a halt. Machine-gun-wielding men in suits and 
ties jumped out of the cars and blasted away at one another. When the smoke 
cleared, two corpses lay on the street. "It was just like an American gangster 
movie," recalls the witness, who was too astonished to take cover. 

The rising power of organized criminals has transformed this manufacturing town 
in the Ural Mountains. Before moving to the Politburo in 1986, Boris N. Yeltsin 
spent 10 years as party boss here, when the city was a tightly controlled hub of 
the Soviet military-industrial complex. During the darkest days of the August 
1991 coup attempt, he secretly ordered a bunker to be prepared outside 
Yekaterinburg to serve, if need be, as the center of a "Free Russian 
Government." 

Notwithstanding the proprietary regard many Yekaterinburgers hold for Yeltsin, 
who became Russia's first democratically elected President in July 1991, when I 
arrived in the city a month after Ternyak's murder, the President and his 
economic reforms hardly figured in everyday conversation. The word I heard most 
often was bezpre del, or "beyond the limit," reflecting the sense most 
Yekaterinburgers have of living on the edge, of being in a frontier town devoid 
of all the comforting signposts of civil society. 

"The failure of the coup was supposed to be the dawn of freedom, the start of a 
new world," says Tamara Lomakina, editor of a Yekaterinburg newspaper called Na 
Smenu (Transition). "But when the sun goes down, we are prisoners in our own 
homes." 

Lomakina, 43, was herself attacked by two men one morning last June as she 
headed down the stairs of her apartment building. One of her assailants kicked 
her in the stomach; the other kicked her in the head. She was struck again and 
again until she lost consciousness. When she woke up in a hospital bed, one side 
of her body was paralyzed and she was temporarily blinded in one eye. 

A few weeks earlier, Lomakina's newspaper published two articles on organized 
crime in the city. "We printed nothing that the police or authorities did not 
already know," she says. Convinced that the crime groups "didn't like the fact 
that we treated them with disrespect," she adds bitterly: "The mafiya control 
this town. I know the same thing is happening in other places. I was talking to 
a friend in Kemerovo" -- a mining town in southern Siberia -- "and he said it 
was worse there, but it doesn't make me feel any better." 

SINCE THE BREAKUP of the Soviet Union in late 1991, nearly every major city in 
Russia has seen a rise in crime. From St. Petersburg to Vladivostok, the police 
are grappling with an epidemic of murder, robbery and mayhem. Last September, 
mobsters even fired a portable anti-tank grenade launcher at a private medical 
clinic on the busy Kutuzovsky Prospekt in Moscow -- probably, say the police, 
because managers of the clinic had resisted some extortionist demand. 

The Ministry of Internal Affairs recorded more than one million "serious" crimes 
in the first seven months of 1992 -- a 40 percent increase over the same period 
in the previous year. Internal Affairs specialists have identified at least 
2,600 separate crime groups across the country over the past year. Most are 
small gangs of racketeers, but investigators say nearly 300 of these are large 
syndicates. 

Last year, investigators prevented a powerful crime group based in the Russian 
autonomous region of Chechen-Ingushetia from swindling the Russian State Bank 
out of 25 billion rubles (then about $1.2 billion). Through bribes, the 
syndicate planned to get bank tellers in Moscow and other cities to accept false 
credit notes presented at their windows. Several million rubles in cash had 
already been collected before the police, alerted by suspicious bank officials, 
moved in. If the scheme had been carried out, investigators said at the time, 
Russia's monetary system would have collapsed. 

Although police professionals have no doubt they are facing sophisticated crime 
syndicates similar to their counterparts in the West, the word "mafiya" remains 
a catchall term for a society emerging from the enforced security of a police 
state and now adrift in a world where nobody seems to bother with rules. 

First widely used in the 1970's -- to describe the corrupt networks of party 
officials and black-market bosses -- the word, as far as the average Russian 
citizen is concerned, can be applied to petty hoodlums terrorizing shopkeepers 
as well as to the (greedy) shopkeepers themselves, to members of crime 
syndicates as well as to the (corrupt) government officials cracking down on 
them, to people who kill for a living as well as to those who make a killing on 
the free market. Even President Yelt sin, faced last year with a citizenry 
angered by spiraling prices following the lifting of price controls, lashed out 
at "mafiya-type structures" that were trying to derail his economic program. 

For most Russians, whose wages have not kept pace with high prices and high 
inflation, today's free market is no different from, and in many ways worse 
than, the black market under the Communists' command economy. For decades 
Russians had to deal with a Government that banned private enterprise at the 
same time that it turned a blind eye to the private marketplace, where most 
Russians obtained the goods they could not get at state stores. The black-market 
dealer could be your next-door neighbor who had an extra supply of caviar from 
his brother in Minsk or he could be the professional salesman who received a 
shipment of quality fur hats from "suppliers" in the state factory. 

The black market fostered furtiveness and dishonesty as much as it served the 
needs of the Soviet consumer, and that is an enduring legacy. Crime groups have 
found it easy to exploit the relaxation of Government regulations by appealing 
to the greed of bureaucrats, customs officials and industrial managers. 

With the partial lifting of restrictions on trade with foreign companies, some 
crime groups have obtained strategic metals and other raw materials cheaply from 
bureaucrats and industrial managers. Using false customs forms, they sell the 
shipments abroad, often well below the world price. Not only does Russia lose 
the customs revenue, but it has ceded control of key natural resources to these 
entrepreneurs. 

Every commodity -- from gold to petroleum -- obtainable on the private market is 
smuggled abroad, usually through ports in the Baltics, by organized groups who 
have bribed their way past Government officials and defense-industry managers. 
Police in Western Europe have even intercepted Russian gang members trying to 
sell a nuclear warhead. 

During the month of October, Russian customs authorities reported the following 
haul of goods destined for illegal shipment abroad: 25 tons of bronze, 6.5 
kilograms of marijuana, 51 railroad cars stocked with rolled steel, 6 wagons 
containing aluminum ingots, 45 wagons of liquid sulfur and 59 cisterns of crude 
oil. 

THE AUDACITY OF Russia's post-Communist criminals has left law-enforcement 
officials groping for explanations. Yuri Mizum, the soft-spoken former police 
chief in one of Yekaterinburg's largest districts who now teaches at the Urals 
College of Security, says many politicians and security officials are part of 
the problem, because of their inability to abandon decades-old strictures 
against private enterprise. 

"When cooperatives were permitted in the mid-80's, at the start of perestroika, 
authorities saw no need to provide them with any special protection," he says. 
"We were all taught to regard private property as somehow illegitimate anyway. 
The police stayed away from these businesses like the plague, and offered them 
no help, so of course when they were threatened by black marketeers, they had no 
alternative but to go along. Now, it's too late." 

Many also tie the current lawlessness to a lack of understanding of what 
constitutes democracy. "A whole class of people appeared who understood 
democracy as being able to do whatever they wanted," says Aslambek Aslakhanov, 
chairman of the Russian parliamentary commission on crime. "That caused complete 
bezpredel, an epidemic of seizing anything in sight, getting rich at any cost. 
In this sort of wild democracy, anybody who wants to make something of himself 
finds it hard to be honest and incorruptible." 

But if some Russians no longer play by the old rules, the existing legal system 
may be as much to blame as "wild democracy." The Soviet criminal code, which 
still remains on the books, was better suited to catch political dissidents than 
to inspire respect for law and order. "Our laws were always aimed at defending 
the totalitarian state, not the individual," admits Aslakhanov. 

Russians, as a result, are now living in a legal jungle. Presidential decrees 
and legislative acts have expanded the boundaries of Russian life -- from the 
right to buy and sell property to the freedom to set up banks and private 
businesses -- but the notoriously inefficient Soviet courts have no legal basis 
for interpreting these decrees, much less enforcing them. 

The police say they cannot, for instance, formally tackle organized criminal 
activity, since under the present law only individuals can be held criminally 
culpable. Aslakhanov, a former senior policeman who is now in charge of drafting 
a criminal code, says the country needs, among others, a law setting up a 
professional, nonpartisan civil service; a law granting immunity to witnesses, 
and a law against official corruption and conflict of interest. 

In the meantime, enterprising individuals and groups have been quick to 
capitalize on the legal muddle. At a news conference last summer in Moscow, 
Andrei Dunayev, a deputy minister of Internal Affairs, admitted that "organized 
criminal structures now operate in almost every region of Russia," but he 
declined to say how much of the Russian economy was under mafiya control. 
Pointing out that his ministry had no way of gathering such figures, he said: 
"Even our specialists find it difficult to determine the legal from the illegal 
-- to determine, for instance, what is profiteering and what is honest trade, or 
determining what is fraud and what is an honest mistake." 

What concerns law-enforcement experts in Yekaterinburg and other Russian cities 
is the blurring of the line between criminal and legitimate business operations. 
"The legalization of private enterprise was a wonderful opportunity for crime 
groups to accumulate capital and influence by investing in legitimate 
businesses, and to became legitimate themselves," says Col. Leonid Zonov, 
retired chief of the Serious Crimes Division in Yekaterinburg and now an adviser 
on crime to the Russian Government. "With their old criminal connections, and 
their muscle, they overwhelm any competition. Eventually, you can't tell the 
criminals from the businessmen." 

To compound the problem, assumptions are widespread that the crime groups are 
not only protected, but also in some cases instructed by Government officials 
and the police. Koltsov, of Internal Affairs in Yekaterinburg, says he believes 
corruption has already penetrated some of the highest levels of the Government 
and security forces. 

"There are professional killers roaming around in this bezpredel," he says, "but 
our country is so divided that police in one region who know of a criminal 
conspiracy affecting another area will not bother to inform their colleagues. 
That's what really worries me." 

But even if the order to clean out corruption came, the police would be ill 
equipped to fulfill it. "We simply don't have the means to act," says Zonov. He 
cites poorly armed police, still known as militia, tracking their suspects on 
public transportation because of the lack of police vehicles. "Our militia get 
paid between 7,000 and 8,000 rubles a month" -- about $22 -- "and you won't find 
many fanatics who will put themselves on the line for that kind of money to 
fight organized crime." Especially when the mafiya is armed with machine guns, 
hand grenades and even hand-held rocket launchers available on the black market 
or sometimes directly from military garrisons. 

ROWS OF SHABBY, HIGH-RISE workers' apartment buildings make Yekaterinburg 
indistinguishable from dozens of gray Russian towns. What sets this city apart 
is an event that took place in 1918. It was in a merchant's house, now 
destroyed, that Czar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks. 


Just as that act of regicide has blighted their past, Yekaterinburgers now see 
the mafiya destroying their present, a view shared even by those directly 
involved in the gangs. A few nights after I arrived in the city, a squat man who 
appeared to be in his late 30's and who had blue prison tattoos on his hands 
reluctantly agreed to meet me outside the former municipal Communist Party 
headquarters. He was accompanied by a group of young hoodlums, who exuded 
sufficient menace for pedestrians to give them a wide berth. 

The man with the tattoos introduced himself as Bolt, adding that he was a senior 
lieutenant of a gang that controlled the illicit supply of vodka and cigarettes 
to downtown stores. He readily admitted he had never spoken to a journalist 
before. The group consented to the meeting only after a go-between had 
approached its boss, currently in prison for reasons no one bothered to explain. 
It was clear Bolt and his friends now felt at loose ends. 

"No one shows us the same respect anymore," Bolt complained. "You get all these 
big shots who think they own the town, people coming in from Moscow. All our 
traditions don't seem to matter." He sounded almost wistful as he recalled an 
earlier time when everyone knew his place. "We kept order here in our own way. 
The party people left us alone and we left them alone." But now, he said, the 
old sources of income -- from protection and smuggling rackets, the selling of 
black-market goods -- were drying up. The large syndicates were expanding 
operations in all sectors of the local economy, and Bolt and his fellow hoodlums 
were forced, as he put it, to "sell their fists" to the same crime lords who 
were putting them out of business. 

Bolt claimed that these crime lords were in the thrall of corrupt politicians in 
Yekaterinburg, adding, with all the wounded pride of a civic-minded citizen, 
"They pour mud on the town." He was pessimistic about the future, predicting 
more violence. "It's terrible what's going on now," he added. "Human values are 
being lost." 

Bolt's lament for the old criminal order is a paradoxical comment on Russia's 
current problems. The underworld is one of Russia's few du rable social 
institutions, prevailing, like the Russian Orthodox Church, over persistent 
attempts at its destruction. In the chaotic years following the 1917 revolution, 
armed gangs left a trail of murder and robbery throughout the countryside, but 
they also served as a secret ally of the state. Bolsheviks used the bank-robbing 
talents of crime gangs to raise the money they needed to survive during their 
years underground. And by sponsoring the black market in the 1970's, the mafiya 
provided the lubricant that made the inefficient Soviet economy run. 

By the time the Soviet Union was broken up, according to investigators, there 
were more than 700 gangs and clans, organized along ethnic or family lines, in 
the country. They were each headed by a boss, called vor v zakone 
(thief-in-law). 

THE POLICE believe there are as many as five syndicates operating in 
Yekaterinburg today. They also suspect that some are run by citizens of 
apparently unimpeachable reputation. One reputed criminal cartel -- whose 
business interests range from a luxurious casino (located a few hundred yards 
from the site where the Czar and his family were murdered) to the illegal export 
of weapons and materiel produced by the military-industrial complex -- is 
believed by the police to be headed by a former Soviet army officer who served 
in Afghanistan. 

Another crime group is called Uralmash, because it operates in the vicinity of a 
giant machine-making plant of the same name. The plant, employing thousands of 
workers, was one of the largest in the Yekaterinburg region and was, say the 
police, long a focus of black-market activity. During the 1970's, two brothers, 
Konstantin and Grigory Tsyganov, ran a smuggling operation based on goods 
obtained from some of the plant supervisors. In return, their gang provided 
under-the-table supplies the supervisors couldn't get anywhere else. 

In late 1991, severe budget cuts in central-Government ministries in Moscow left 
the Uralmash plant, like many state enterprises of its size, strapped for cash. 
The Uralmash gang came to the rescue, according to the police, virtually moving 
inside the factory door. The mobsters set up subsidiaries to purchase directly 
from the factory's assembly line, took over the factory's former Soviet-style 
youth club and established their own soccer team, restaurant, sportswear outlet 
and, reputedly, brokerage house. 

Yekaterinburg's export-import trade, construction industry and most of the 
town's financial and banking services, say the police, are either under the 
control of or influenced by crime groups. Leonid Zonov, the former Serious 
Crimes Division chief, is careful to avoid portraying Yekaterinburg's entire new 
economy as tainted by criminality. But, he says, the syndicates' growing power 
makes the presence of individual honest entrepreneurs irrelevant. 

Koltsov, of the local branch of Internal Affairs, says: "No honest businessman 
can do anything in this city unless he pays unofficial taxes to crime groups, 
who in turn control many of our officials through bribes. We know billions of 
rubles are collected this way every month." 

Gangland bloodletting began in earnest in Yekaterinburg in the spring of 1992, 
when a minor gang leader known as Polecat was murdered. There were rumors that 
several crime groups were at odds over the distribution of profits and 
territories opened up by new Government decrees lifting state control on trade 
in raw materials. A few months later, Grigory Tsyganov, then head of the 
Uralmash crime syndicate, was murdered. Soon afterward, a prominent black 
marketeer named Pavel Tarlanov disappeared, and is presumed dead. A few weeks 
later, his father, the alleged leader of one of the city's most venerable gangs, 
was assassinated with a shot fired through the window of his home. 

These deaths, and a subsequent wave of firebombings and shootouts, were believed 
linked to an attempt by the Tarlanov family to obtain lucrative contracts for 
soon-to-be-privatized gasoline stations in town. Police investigators knew 
several of the syndicates had their eyes on the same gold mine. 

The killing of Viktor Ternyak demonstrated that to maintain their supremacy the 
syndicates were prepared to destabilize the very economy that provided them with 
expanding profits. There are some local businessmen, however, who have managed 
to defy the crime lords -- and survive. 

Aleksandr Ponomaryev, the 46-year-old owner of a successful oil-and-gas export 
firm, resisted the syndicates during a campaign of harassment that lasted nearly 
two years. Ponomaryev, who in 1990 owned one of the two foreign-model cars in 
town, a Volkswagen (Ternyak's Volvo was the other), was stopped on the street by 
a man demanding he sell the automobile to a "friend." Ponomaryev refused, even 
when, as the demands continued, it became apparent that the "friend" was a 
well-known Yekaterinburg racketeer. 

The tactics grew violent. Ponomaryev's apartment was robbed and someone tossed a 
can of gasoline through an open window in his other car as it sat parked on the 
street. The gang boss, whom Ponomaryev refuses to identify, finally paid him a 
visit. 

"He said if I did not stop being so uncooperative, I would soon have neither my 
business nor my car," Ponomaryev recalls, "and he added he knew where my 
children went to school." Ponomaryev caved in. He gave the car away last 
February. 

But then the harassment took another turn. Telephone callers demanded he pay 
$500,000, or a monthly percentage of his business income, to a new gang leader 
who had killed his former tormenter. Ponomaryev resisted. A week after Ternyak's 
death in September, Ponomaryev was savagely beaten and stabbed in the corridor 
leading to his office. 

When we met in the nondescript apartment of a friend in downtown Yekaterinburg, 
he lifted his shirt and bulletproof vest to show me the two jagged knife scars 
running diagonally down the length of his chest cavity, close to his heart. A 
bodyguard sat across from him with a long-barreled handgun resting on his lap. 

"It was not just the gangs that wanted to stop me," he says. "I have only 
recently begun to discover who in the city administration are robbers and 
bribe-takers." 

Businessmen like Ponomaryev who are willing to stand up to the gangs and corrupt 
officials are in a minority. But they point the way toward the mafiya's ultimate 
defeat, says Koltsov of Internal Affairs, who was impressed enough with the oil 
entrepreneur's courage to organize a special security detail for him. In return, 
Ponomaryev has agreed to finance a private security service for city 
businessmen. 

Koltsov, who plans to retire from the police to serve as a director of the new 
security service, says the mafiya is far from being as powerful as it thinks it 
is. "When they fail with someone like Mr. Ponomaryev, it weakens them in 
everyone else's eyes, and they know that," he says. "If we can get tough laws 
and, much more important, tough enforcement, we still have a chance." 

CAN YELTSIN'S reformers crack down on organized crime without endangering the 
state's passage from Communism to capitalism? 

The fall of the old regime has put vast amounts of wealth and resources up for 
grabs. Russia's lack of experience with a free-market economy and the crippling 
ambiguity of its legal system virtually guarantee that only the most ruthless 
will be willing to take the risks involved. 

Some Russians argue, therefore, that a period of lawlessness is part of the 
price every society pays for radical economic change. Pointing to examples as 
disparate as the development of the American West and the transformation of 
Latin American economies, they suggest that without a certain amount of 
robber-baron-style entrepreneurship, the consumer goods in most Russian cities 
would disappear. 

"The mobs have put millions of rubles that used to be concealed in the black 
market into circulation," says Sergei Plotnikov, a Na Smenu reporter whose crime 
stories provoked the attack on Tamara Lomakina. "That money is now subject to 
taxes, so why should officials try to stop it, especially when there's no money 
coming in from the central Government?" 

But winking at organized crime, as officials in many Russian regions now do, 
could lead to a different political nightmare. During my visit to Yekaterinburg, 
it was clear that the town's economic boom had opened a gulf between the very 
rich and the very poor. One afternoon, I attended a fashion show at the local 
theater sponsored by the sportswear outlet of the Uralmash syndicate. The 
invitation-only audience was a cross-section of Yekaterinburg's post-Communist 
elite: the women with their bouffant hairdos, flashy jewelry and tight dresses; 
the men in their well-cut suits. 

A few blocks away, however, factory workers in ragged clothes, barefoot beggars 
and obviously malnourished children waited silently in the town's filthy central 
railway station. 

Vocal Russian conservatives regularly harp on the contrast between the opulent 
life styles of entrepreneurs and the crushing poverty of "decent people," citing 
that as a reason for slowing down or reversing economic reform. The link made by 
the conservatives between the high crime rate and the get-rich-quick mania -- a 
connection also made by the public -- helped force last month's resignation of 
the Russian Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, an ardent advocate of Western-style 
capitalism. 

Some Russians warn a powerful "Red-Brown" alliance of disgruntled members of the 
former Soviet establishment and xenophobic right-wing parties is already 
collaborating on programs that would rid the country of its free-market 
entrepreneurs, criminal or not. 

"If people begin to equate freedom and democracy with crime and anarchy," says 
Tamara Lomakina, "they will support political forces who say they can eliminate 
the bezpredel by strong-arm measures. There is really only one political force 
in this country that is strong enough to do that right now, together with the 
army." She paused. "I mean the fascists."
