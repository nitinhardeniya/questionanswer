    Police Maj. Vladimir Kanunnikov patrols a working-class neighborhood 
in northern Moscow, preaching the virtues of strong families and keeping 
tabs on criminals and troublemakers he calls "parasites." 

If a card game explodes in a brawl, or neighbors in a communal apartment 
square off with frying pans or knives, Kanunnikov answers the alarm. 

And then there are the telephone calls that start "Someone's going to get 
killed, either him or me," Kanunnikov said, describing the marital 
violence he tries to mediate before it explodes into murder. 

Russia has become a world leader in homicide, chalking up close to three 
times more murders per capita each year than the United States, five times 
more than France, and seven times more than Germany. Only a handful of 
countries, including Colombia, outstrip Russia, although there are no 
exact global figures. 

The soaring murder rate is part of a broader explosion of crime in Russia. 
The country's economic slide is partly to blame; so are the opportunities 
opened by economic reforms. There are more and better cars to steal, more 
and wealthier customers for prostitutes, more and pricier properties to 
fight over. 

Jobs, education and technical training - to say nothing of salaries, 
pensions and other social support - are no longer guaranteed. Laws and 
policing have weakened, drug use has soared and corruption is rampant. 

"There's been a massive catastrophe of values, a loss of goals," said Igor 
Arshinov, a psychologist at Moscow's Institute of Neuroses. "Earlier, 
society was building communism. People knew it was idiotic, but on some 
level they still bought into it." 

The country's murder rate doubled between 1990, the first year official 
nationwide murder figures were published, and 1994, when the level of 
murders and murder attempts reached 32,286. The next year, it began a 
three-year dip nationwide, but resumed its rise again last year, to reach 
about 29,550, according to the Interior Ministry. 

The contract hits and gangland wars that fill Russian newspaper columns 
and television screens account for just a fraction of the murder toll. In 
1998, about 43 percent of murders took place in private, up from 35 
percent a decade earlier, the Interior Minister said. According to the 
Russian Criminological Institute, which works with unpublished data, such 
murders have always been in the majority, comprising 60 percent of the 
whole. 

These murders are committed by neighbors, drinking buddies, husbands, 
wives and children - not gangsters. 

The Interior Ministry lumps them all in the category of "crimes committed 
against the background of everyday life." There are no separate statistics 
on domestic violence; women's rights advocates say that reflects what a 
low priority it is for law enforcement agencies. 

"Many people here don't accept that domestic violence is a crime. In our 
society, it's considered the norm," said Elena Potapova, the telephone 
hotline coordinator for Moscow's No to Violence women's crisis center. 

A U.S.-Russian study published in 1997 showed that 1.7 times more Russians 
than Americans are killed by their spouses, and that Russian women are 2 
times more likely than American women to be killed by husbands. 

Two factors of Russian life have consistently kept the level of everyday 
murders high. The first is alcohol abuse, which Moscow police say is 
involved in four-fifths of everyday murders. If alcoholism was checked 
somewhat in Soviet times, now it faces practically no constraints. 

"Alcoholism has always been our national habit, but now there are 
absolutely no limitations on when you can get hold of liquor or how much 
you can drink," Arshinov said. 

The second factor is Russia's chronic housing shortage: People cannot 
afford to move out of trouble's way, and the country's economic decline 
has put unprecedented pressure on families. 

"Divorced couples continue to live in the same apartment, and so do all 
the generations, with old people, children, grandchildren, and new 
daughters-in-law," said Masha Mukhova of the Sisters crisis center in 
Moscow. 

"There's no exit. The situation itself provokes violence." 

The burden of preventing everyday violence falls on policemen like 
Kanunnikov. The clean-cut 44-year-old sits at his desk ramrod-straight, 
like a soldier, but slides easily into conversation like an old neighbor. 

He says the job was easier in Soviet times, when there was a range of 
disciplinary institutions, from mandatory alcoholism treatment centers to 
so-called comrades' courts. 

"Then it was decided that these weren't democratic institutions, so they 
were abolished and everything fell on police shoulders: We're the comrade 
court, the priest and the psychotherapist who have to persuade people to 
live like human beings," Kanunnikov said. 

He and the women's crisis center staff say they have increasingly few 
legal tools at their disposal to punish violent offenders. As long as 
there's no place for victims to take shelter, the violence will continue 
to take a heavy toll. 

"It's practically impossible to solve this problem in the near future, 
because it requires a very serious government program in which one of the 
priorities would be municipal housing for victims of domestic violence," 
Potapova said.
