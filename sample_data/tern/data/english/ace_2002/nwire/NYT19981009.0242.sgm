The cynical cliche has it that ``business ethics'' is an
oxymoron and that getting ahead requires locking one's conscience
in a desk drawer. But three-quarters of working American adults say
they have never been asked or told to do something they thought was
unethical on the job, according to a survey by Yankelovich Partners
released last week.
And of those who were, 4 in 10 said they actually did the dirty
deed.
When the survey asked what they would do if they found out an
employer was up to no good, only a handful said they would choose
one of the popularly imagined horns of the dilemma _ looking the
other way (9 percent) or quitting (5 percent). The vast majority,
78 percent, said they would talk to the boss or otherwise try to
resolve the situation without losing their jobs, a finding that
suggests most people feel they have some scope to affect ethical
behavior in their workplaces. (The remaining 8 percent were unsure
what they would do or gave other answers.)
Who is most often put on the spot? The survey found that
slightly more men than women, and more people with some college
education than those without, have been asked to do something they
thought was unethical, a finding that may simply mirror differences
in the kinds of jobs most often held by people in each group.
Harder to interpret is a finding that more people who live in
the South and West or in rural areas in general report having been
asked to transgress than people who live in the Northeast or
Midwest or in towns, suburbs and cities generally. Greater rates of
churchgoing in the South and in rural areas don't seem to be the
reason: Responses nationwide from people who said they regularly
attend religious services were no different from others' responses.
The survey of 1,002 American adults was conducted in June,
before President Clinton's public acknowledgment of an
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky or Independent
Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report to Congress.
Yankelovich Partners conducted the survey for the Lutheran
Brotherhood, an organization owned by its 1.1 million Lutheran
members. The group provides insurance and other financial services
and operates charitable programs, and it often sponsors surveys on
ethical and other issues.
