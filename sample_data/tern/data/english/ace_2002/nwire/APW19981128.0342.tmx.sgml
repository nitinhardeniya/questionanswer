TOKYO (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin again urged Japan to
come to grips with <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-28T09:20" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">its wartime past</TIMEX2> on <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>, but his speech was
interrupted by students protesting his nation's human rights
record.
Three protesters were arrested after scuffling with security
guards in the auditorium at Tokyo's Waseda University, where Jiang
was delivering a speech.
One demonstrator unfurled a banner reading: ``Down with the
Jiang regime.''
Jiang ignored them, raising his voice over their shouts.
``Thirty-five million Chinese soldiers and civilians were either
killed or injured, and China suffered economic losses worth more
than 600 billion dollars,'' he said in his speech.
Sitting near the Chinese president was Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, a Waseda graduate.
Outside, scores of students protested the treatment of Chinese
dissidents and Beijing's nuclear weapons program. Several of the
protesters, who shouted slogans and carried anti-Chinese placards,
were dragged away by police.
While Jiang will travel in northern Japan until <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>, Japanese
media have already begun to raise doubts about what his visit _ the
first ever by a Chinese head of state _ has accomplished.
There has been much speculation that Jiang was disappointed by
Japan's refusal to issue a clear written apology for its wartime
aggression against China.
``Can we say that President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan has
been a `success'? To be a bit pessimistic, we don't think so,''
Japan's conservative Sankei newspaper said in an editorial
<TIMEX2 val="1998-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>.
Since arriving <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-25" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2>, Jiang has taken every opportunity to
remind Japanese that they must apologize for the atrocities
committed before and during World War II, if they hope to build
better relations with China.
A joint communique issued <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2> mentioned Japan's ``remorse''
for the war. But it did not use the word ``apology,'' which Japan
had offered South Korea in writing during President Kim Dae-jung's
visit to Tokyo <TIMEX2 val="1998-10" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2>.
Although Japanese media reports have said that the decision not
to sign the communique was highly unusual, Jiang and Japanese
officials played down its significance.
``Chinese and Japanese officials never considered the option of
signing the joint communique,'' Jiang said at a news conference
<TIMEX2 val="1998-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">later Saturday</TIMEX2>.
On <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-26" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>, Obuchi also gave a vaguely worded answer to Jiang
on Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province.
Obuchi said Japan does not support Taiwanese independence and
reassured Jiang that Japan's security arrangement with the United
States was only for defense.
``Japan has given a clear, adequate statement'' opposing
Taiwanese independence, Jiang told the news conference. ``I want
Japan to observe its promises.''
<TIMEX2 val="1998-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Later Saturday</TIMEX2>, Jiang arrived and attended a reception in the
northern city of Sendai.
On <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, he will visit a monument to Chinese writer Lu Xun,
who studied in that city. He will then visit farms on the northern
Japanese island of Hokkaido.
