   The manager of a large industrial firm in northern Russia has been murdered 
in his office, police reported Monday in the latest in a series of 
assassinations of leading businessmen in the region. 

Police, quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency, said Yevgeny Shulman, 44, was 
"murdered in unclear circumstances" in his offices at Splav, a company in 
Novgorod which makes equipment for nuclear power plants and oil refineries. 

Police said the murder may have been the work of hired killers, the agency 
reported. 

Shulman was also a deputy in the regional parliament. 

He was the third leading businessman murdered in northern Russia this month. 

On January 10, the chief financial officer of one of Russia's leading brewers, 
Baltika, was murdered by hired killers in Saint Petersburg, according to police. 

Three days later, the 27-year-old director of a building supplies store in the 
same city was slain.
