   In a verdict hailed as a major strike against the growing influence of 
Russian organized crime in the United States, a Federal jury in Brooklyn 
<TIMEX2 val="1996-07-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2> convicted a man who the authorities say is the most powerful Russian 
mobster in the country. 

After a <TIMEX2 val="P6W" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-W28" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">six-week</TIMEX2> trial, the jurors took <TIMEX2 val="PT5H" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-07-08" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="">about five hours</TIMEX2> to convict Vyacheslav 
Kirillovich Ivankov, 56, and three co-defendants of extortion charges. 

During the trial, which was so studded with Russian names that it evoked a novel 
by Tolstoy, prosecutors outlined how Mr. Ivankov had tried to extort $3.5 
million from two Russian emigres who ran an investment company. Mr. Ivankov was 
branded a top mobster who relied on his ability to inspire fear to carry out his 
schemes. 

"We're glad that an early attempt by the F.B.I. to strike at this group before 
they really spread out was successful," Bridget M. Rohde, a prosecutor, said. 
The case "was unusual in that Ivankov had only been here for <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four years</TIMEX2>," Ms. 
Rohde said. "His tentacles had not spread out." 

Russian authorities advised the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Mr. Ivankov 
formed his criminal organization in Russia <TIMEX2 val="1980" mod="APPROX" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">about 16 years ago</TIMEX2>. After being 
convicted for his participation in several thefts from the home of wealthy 
Russians, Mr. Ivankov served <TIMEX2 val="P10Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1991" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">10 years</TIMEX2> in a Russian prison. 

The authorities also said that since Mr. Ivankov's release in <TIMEX2 val="1991" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1991</TIMEX2>, he began to 
build and solidify his criminal associations in the United States. In <TIMEX2 val="1993-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January 
1993</TIMEX2>, the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) of the Russian Federation advised the 
F.B.I. that Mr. Ivankov entered the United States to manage and control Russian 
organized crime activities in this country, operating from his base in Brighton 
Beach, Brooklyn. 

Mr. Ivankov was found guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion and attempted 
extortion. He faces <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="anchor is unclear, due to time served">up to 20 years</TIMEX2> in prison. 

When the verdict was read <TIMEX2 val="1996-07-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2>, Mr. Ivankov, an illegal immigrant, sat 
expressionless. His lawyer, Barry I. Slotnick, said he was shocked at the 
verdict and would appeal. 

"I think the jury unfortunately may have heard the word 'Russian' and had some 
preconceived notions," Mr. Slotnick said. "Certainly the evidence was not 
there." 

While the authorities said the trial would provide a window into the mechanics 
of Russian organized crime in America, Mr. Slotnick had argued that the real 
lesson was how greedy nascent capitalists -- in this case the emigres who the 
prosecution said were the victims of the alleged extortion plot -- came to the 
United States to exploit fellow immigrants with bogus schemes. 

Mr. Slotnick had portrayed his client as being falsely accused by the men who 
ran the investment company -- whom he called swindlers -- after Mr. Ivankov 
helped arrange a meeting between them and an official of a Russian bank that had 
been defrauded by the company. 

The lawyer described Mr. Ivankov as a freedom fighter for religious and civil 
rights in Russia. 

As Mr. Ivankov was being escorted out of the courtroom, he was heard yelling out 
several words bitterly in Russian. 

But Mr. Slotnick said Mr. Ivankov told him: "Don't worry. You've done a 
wonderful job. We'll keep fighting. This is America." 

Mr. Ivankov's arrest in New York in <TIMEX2 val="1995-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June 1995</TIMEX2>, along with several associates, 
followed an intensive investigation by the F.B.I. that was aided by Russia's 
Ministry of the Interior and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 

Prosecutors had asserted that none of the $3.5 million demanded was paid because 
one of the operators of the investment company, the Summit International Trading 
and Investment Corporation, went to the F.B.I., which secretly taped 
conversations that implicated Mr. Ivankov in the shakedown. 

Mr. Ivankov was arrested in his girlfriend's apartment in Brighton Beach, the 
center of the Russian emigre community in America. 

But Mr. Slotnick said the two principals of Summit International, Vladimir 
Voloshin and Alexander Volkov, were not victims of what the prosecution called a 
<TIMEX2 val="P7M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="strarting in late 1994, actually. Do we need MOD on anchor vals?">seven-month</TIMEX2> extortion plot in <TIMEX2 val="1994" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">late 1994</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2>. 

Instead, he argued, they went to the F.B.I. because the pyramid scheme he 
insisted they were operating was about to be exposed and they sought to escape 
the consequences by picturing themselves as victims. 

Two co-defendants, Sergei Ilgner and Valery Novak, were convicted of conspiracy 
to commit extortion and attempted extortion. Vladimir Topko was convicted of 
conspiracy to commit extortion but was acquitted of attempted extortion. The 
defendants face <TIMEX2 val="P20Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">up to 20 years</TIMEX2> imprisonment and a $250,000 fine on each count of 
conviction as well as deportation. 

The trial was closely monitored by reporters from Russia. And <TIMEX2 val="1996-07-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2>, many of 
them said that they, too, were stunned by the verdict, because they believed the 
Government's case was weak. 

Some court spectators suggested that the trial brought into sharp focus how 
<TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996-07-09" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Communists and "new" businessmen have done business since the fall of the 
Soviet Union, but not so much how Mr. Ivankov is the Russian mob's equivalent of 
John Gotti. 

"It's definitely a big win for the Government," said Stephen Handelman, the 
author of "Comrade Criminal: Russia's New Mafia" (Yale University Press, <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2>).
