    A court in the northern city of Murmansk has sentenced to death a man found 
guilty of organizing contract murders and arranging a bomb blast that killed two 
children, a news agency reported <TIMEX2 val="1997-05-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Thursday</TIMEX2>. 

The sentence was issued <TIMEX2 val="1997-05-14" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> by the Murmansk District Court, ITAR-Tass 
reported. 

The defendant, Dmitry Galkin, was the leader of a gang that terrorized 
northwestern Russia for <TIMEX2 val="PXY" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1997" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="maybe it was before an earlier time; he could have been in jail for a while already">years</TIMEX2> and had killed many prominent businessmen, the 
report said. 

The report gave no details of the crimes. 

Other members of the gang have been charged with murder, robbery and fraud, the 
report said. 

Russia pledged to outlaw capital punishment in <TIMEX2 val="1996-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January 1996</TIMEX2> when it joined the 
Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights organization. 

Human rights activists say Russia since has executed 62 prisoners. A Russian 
Supreme Court justice told parliament the executions ended in <TIMEX2 val="1996-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">May 1996</TIMEX2>. 

Russia's hard-line parliament <TIMEX2 val="1997-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2> rejected a bill that would suspend 
capital punishment on the grounds that it is important for containing the 
soaring crime rate.
