MOSCOW (AP) _ Fearing Western air strikes against Iraq, Moscow
began withdrawing some Russian personnel from Baghdad on Sunday, a
government spokesman said.
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov later said the decision had been
made ``in a rather tense psychological situation,'' before the
United States backed down from its threat to carry out attacks.
More than 100 people, mostly employees of the Russian embassy in
Iraq and some of their family members, left for the city of
Kermanshah in Iran by bus, the duty officer at the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
The ministry sent two planes to Kermanshah to pick up the
Russian citizens, who were expected to arrive in Moscow late Sunday
or Monday.
Ivanov, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, told reporters that ``no state in the world''
had backed Iraq's decision to bar U.N. weapons inspections and he
applauded the Iraqi decision to back down.
Interfax reported that Ivanov met with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to discuss the Iraqi situation.
``We have common final objectives, we agree that the Security
Council's resolution must be fulfilled and the U.N. Special
Commission must continue its work in full and without any
preconditions,'' he said.
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein halted United Nations' monitoring of
weapons sites Oct. 31. But the latest crisis has been building
since Aug. 5 when Iraq prohibited field inspections for nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.
Iraq sent a letter to the U.N. Saturday saying arms inspectors
could return, but the United States has said it fails to meet
American conditions to resume checks.
Russia has consistently argued against the use of force against
Iraq, and has sought to mediate in Iraq's frequent confrontations
with the West.
