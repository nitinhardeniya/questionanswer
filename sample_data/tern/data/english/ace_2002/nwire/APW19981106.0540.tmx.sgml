PARIS (AP) _ Pig farmers blocked roads and held noisy rallies
across France <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> to protest plunging prices and to demand rapid
distribution of government aid.
Four thousand farmers rallied in the city of Rennes, Britanny. A
delegation of pork producers was to meet with local authorities.
A rally was also being held in Bailleul, northern France, where
dozens of farmers at <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-06TMI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">midday</TIMEX2> set tires and haystacks on fire. Other
rallies were planned in Montauban and Lyon.
In northern France, traffic was snarled on a major highway after
farmers deliberately drove slowly and blocked access roads between
Dunkirk and Lille.
Farmers have been squeezed for <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">months</TIMEX2> by the price of pork,
which was selling <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> at 5.18 francs (95 cents) a kilo (2.2
pounds), about 4 francs (70 cents) below production costs. They say
they can't cover their costs with such low prices, caused by
falling demand and overproduction.
The French government said <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-03" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> it would provide 150 million
francs (dlrs 27 million) in extra aid to the producers. The farmers
said <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> they would not tolerate any delay.
``Since <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of 1997</TIMEX2> I've been losing money,'' said Pierre
Hughes, a pig farmer from Fletres. ``I had put some money aside,
but if this continues the banks will cut off my allowance.''
