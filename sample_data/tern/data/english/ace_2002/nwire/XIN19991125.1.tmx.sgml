Arms Control Official on Theater Missile Defensive (TMD)

An official with the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-11-25" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent</TIMEX2>
interview with Xinhua that "China does not reject the whole concept of
TMD".

China understands the role of TMD in protecting stationed troops and
what China opposes is the advanced TMD system which could be employed
during National Missile Defensive, Sha Zukang, director of the Arms
Control Department of the Foreign Ministry, said, adding that "this
will undermine the strategic balance."  Sha pointed out that it is not
necessary for Japan to join the TMD of the United States. Even when
faced with the bigger threat during <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="like ... era.">the cold war period</TIMEX2> than at
<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-11-25" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">present</TIMEX2>, Japan did not think of TMD, and it is more unnecessary for
Japan to do so <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-11-25" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> for the international relations are relaxed,
relations between big nations are improved and the Japan-Russian
relations have improved remarkably, and peace and development have
become the trend of <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-11-25" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">the time</TIMEX2>, Sha said.

"The so-called threat from Democratic People's Republic of Korea to
Japan is just a pretext," Sha added.

Responding to the question of whether Japan's participation in TMD of
the United States might trigger the arms race between China and Japan,
Sha said that China, as all other sovereign states, will take
"necessary measures" to safeguard its national security and
territorial integrity.

However, Sha pointed out that "China did not, does not and will not
participate in any form of arms race, and even if Japan is willing to,
China will not do so."
