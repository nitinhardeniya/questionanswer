HEADLINE: Vietnamese cigarette maria in Berlin court for murder

<TEXT>
   Sixteen members of the Ngoc-Thien Vietnamese cigarette mafia resumed their 
trial here Wednesday for nine murders as well as kidnapping and racketeering. 

The trial had begun in August but was interrupted after three weeks as one of 
the accused had tuberculosis and was contagious. 

The alleged gang leader, Duy Bao, 26, was suspected of having ordered the 
killing of six Vietnamese found bound and shot in May 1996 in an apartment in 
Berlin. 

The gang controlled two-thirds of the some 1,200 cigarette vending machines in 
metro and tram stations in the German capital. 

The accused, ranging in age from 18 to 43, risked life in prison. 

The gang had its origins in the Vietnamese community that came to then East 
Germany under accords between communist states, and has been involved since 1992 
in internecine warfare for control of the lucrative contraband cigarette trade.
