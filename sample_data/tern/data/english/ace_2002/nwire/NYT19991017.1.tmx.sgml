MOSCOW -- In a dramatic reversal of previous policy, the United States
is <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-10-17" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> offering to help Russia complete a large missile tracking radar
if Moscow agrees in exchange to renegotiate what both countries long
saw as a landmark arms control agreement.

The confidential proposal to help the Russians finish their radar near
Irkutsk, Siberia, is part of an intensive American campaign laying the
groundwork for a defense against potential missile attacks from North
Korea and other nations, Russian and American officials say.

Such a nationwide defense is prohibited by the <TIMEX2 val="1972" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1972</TIMEX2> Antiballistic
Missile Treaty, a pact viewed for <TIMEX2 val="P25Y" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1972" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="probably STARTING in 1972, but can't be sure">more than 25 years</TIMEX2> as the bedrock of
arms control. Moscow has so far refused to alter it, and announced on
<TIMEX2 val="1999-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> -- <TIMEX2 val="1999-10-15" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="Appositive with Friday.">two days after the Senate voted down a nuclear test ban
treaty</TIMEX2> -- that it would work with China to seek support at the United
Nations against American efforts to alter the accord.

The increasingly heated dispute over antimissile defenses comes as the
structure of arms control appears to be under siege. The Senate vote
drew widespread criticism around the world. The Russian Parliament,
meanwhile, has blocked progress on further arms reductions by failing
to ratify the Start II treaty.

In addition, the war Russia is fighting in Chechnya means that Moscow
has hundreds more armored vehicles in the Northern Caucusus than it is
permitted to under a key <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2> accord limiting ground troops and
conventional weapons in Europe.

"It used to be argued that rogue states were the main threat to
strategic stability," said Sergei Rogov, the director of the
U.S.-Canada Institute. "<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-10-17" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2> it is the United States and Russia who
refuse to ratify and implement agreements and who violate their
terms."

Senior American officials insist that the Clinton Administration is
not aiming to nullify the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Rather, they
maintain, the goal is to update the accord so that the United States
can defend itself against new missile threats while at the same time
avoiding a new arms race with Russia and China. A formal decision on
whether to proceed with antimissile defenses is to be made by <TIMEX2 val="2000-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next
summer</TIMEX2>, based on technical, economic and arms control considerations.
But Russian officials insist that Washington has vastly exaggerated
the missile threat arising from undeclared or potential nuclear powers
and say that weakening the ABM treaty would be a reckless move.  "What
happened to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was a disaster," said
Grigory V. Berdennikof, a senior arms control specialist at Russia's
Foreign Ministry.

"If it happens to the ABM treaty," he said, "it will be a quadruple
disaster. The pattern is clear."

When the ABM treaty was concluded, the argument against development of
national antimissile defense systems in Russia and the United States
was that they would encourage both sides to accumulate more arms to
penetrate such shields.

When the Soviet Union built a radar in <TIMEX2 val="198" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1980's</TIMEX2> at Krasnoyarsk,
Siberia, to fill a gap in its radar coverage, the United States argued
successfully that it was a violation of the treaty and pressed the
Russians to dismantle it.

In <TIMEX2 val="1999-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">January</TIMEX2>, however, the Clinton Administration took a different tack.
President Clinton sent President Boris N. Yeltsin a letter asking
Russia to renegotiate the treaty to permit a limited system of
defenses.

The Administration insisted that the accord had to be updated because
nations like North Korea and Iran were developing the means to
manufacture ocean-spanning ballistic missiles. American intelligence
analysts revised their estimates after they failed to anticipate North
Korea's unsuccessful effort to launch a tiny satellite into space in
<TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1998</TIMEX2> using a three-stage missile.

"During <TIMEX2 val="P15Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">the next 15 years</TIMEX2>, the United States will mostly face ICBM
threats from Russia, China, and North Korea, probably from Iran, and
possibly from Iraq," American intelligence experts said in a report
<TIMEX2 val="1999-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2>.

Critics of the Clinton Administration, however, say politics was the
driving force behind the proposal. They charge that Clinton is trying
to insure that Vice President Al Gore could not be accused of being
soft on defense in the coming presidential race by rushing ahead with
plans for an antimissile system that may not be effective.  "The
proposed defense is fundamentally very fragile," said Theodore A.
Postol, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "It
seems to be a case of subordinating national security to domestic
politics."

With strong support for an antimissile defense in the
Republican-dominated Congress, financing is not a problem. The hard
part is persuading Russia and China that they should cooperate with
the American antimissile plan and not respond by expanding their
nuclear arsenals.

Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has held a series of
high-level meetings with the Russians, including a session <TIMEX2 val="1999-W41" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2>
in Helsinki with Grigory Mamedov, a senior official at the Russian
Foreign Ministry.

By outlining their plans, the Americans are seeking to reassure the
Russians that the proposed missile defense is not aimed at them.
According to Russian and American officials familiar with the talks,
the first phase of the American antimissile system is to be completed
by <TIMEX2 val="2005" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2005</TIMEX2>. It involves building a powerful new battle-management radar
in Alaska and deploying up to 100 antimissile interceptors there.
American early warning radars in Greenland and Britain and on the east
and west coasts of the United States would also be upgraded.

American officials assert that the system would be able to stop a
limited attack involving relatively unsophisticated missiles.  The
second phase is to be completed by <TIMEX2 val="2010" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2010</TIMEX2>, and could involve
construction of a similar radar at Grand Forks, N.D., and deployment
of 100 interceptors there.

This level of defense, American officials maintain, would enable the
United States to protect itself against a limited missile attack that
involved several tens of missiles with more sophisticated warheads and
decoys.

But the defense could easily be swamped by Russia's vast arsenal, thus
preserving strategic equilibrium between Washington and Moscow,
American officials say.

In addition to outlining the proposed missile defense, Washington has
sought to reassure the Russians by offering cooperation in several
areas.

An offer to help the cash-strapped Russians complete a large radar at
Mishelevka, 60 miles northwest of Irkutsk, is included, which could
cost millions of dollars. Oriented to the southeast, the radar covers
North Korea, among other Asian nations.

Washington has also suggested that it might upgrade a
Russian-controlled radar at Lyaki in Azerbaijan. Oriented toward the
south, the radar covers Iran and other Middle Eastern nations.  Under
the American plan, the Lyaki station might be jointly manned with the
Russians. But the proposal has yet to be negotiated with the
Government of Azerbaijan, and key details about American access to
Russian radar data have not been worked out.

Other proposals include Russian visits to American early warning radar
stations and, perhaps, access to their data, including that from the
new radar to be built in Alaska. American officials have also proposed
joint computer simulations of antimissile systems and collaboration in
deploying satellite systems.

So far, the Russians have said that weakening the ABM treaty is too
high a price to pay.

"We are open to cooperation," said Berdennikof, the Russian arms
control specialist. "But if our cooperation means changing the ABM
treaty our answer is 'thanks but no thanks.' "

Russian officials insist that the United States has exaggerated North
Korea's capacity to develop long-range missiles while minimizing the
forms of political and military leverage Washington has over the
North.

But Russia's major concern is the effect of the American plan on its
nuclear arsenal. Russian officials fear that the costly new radars and
command control system the United States might erect in <TIMEX2 val="20" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the next
century</TIMEX2> will become the building blocks for a more comprehensive
antimissile defense.

Since Russia is too poor to engage in that kind of arms race, the only
way it could maintain a strategic balance with the United States would
be to cast aside the agreements it negotiated with Washington in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-10-17" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the
past</TIMEX2> and build up its arsenal.

One relatively cheap countermeasure would be deployment of land-based
missiles with multiple warheads -- either old SS-18 missiles or new
Topol-M missiles -- a move that would undo one of the main
achievements of arms control.

Russian officials also say they have already begun to consult with
China about possible political and military cooperation in the event
that the United States withdraws from the ABM treaty.

American intelligence experts say that China will have "tens of
missiles" that can reach the United States by <TIMEX2 val="2015" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">2015</TIMEX2>, a threat
especially vulnerable to American advances in antimissile defenses.  A
senior American official dismissed many of the Russian objections to
renegotiating the ABM treaty as public posturing intended to weaken
Western support for missile defenses and said that it differed from
what he called the businesslike tone of private meetings. Still, there
seems little doubt that the dispute over an antimissile system will
escalate sharply in <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-10" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="">coming months</TIMEX2>.

The Clinton Administration says it will not make a formal decision on
whether to proceed with its anti-missile program before <TIMEX2 val="2000-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next summer</TIMEX2>,
although it is widely presumed that Washington will go ahead.  The
timing is determined by intelligence estimates and budgetary
procedures in the United States. But it means that the decision is
likely to fall on <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored">the eve of the Russian presidential election</TIMEX2>,
insuring that the issue gets added to the growing litany of bitter
American-Russian disputes.
