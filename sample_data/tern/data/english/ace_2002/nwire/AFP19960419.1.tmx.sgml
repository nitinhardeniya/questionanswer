   The mayor of the central Russian town of Orenburg was lightly wounded 
<TIMEX2 val="1996-04-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> in an apparent bomb attack, ITAR-TASS news agency reported. 

Gennady Donkovtsev was leaving his apartment in the centre of the Urals 
town to go to the town hall when two blasts went off nearby. 

Donkovtsev was taken to hospital, but his condition was not serious, town 
hall officials were quoted by Echo Moscow radio as saying. 

Police immediately opened an inquiry, but the town hall press service said 
it was too early to say whether the blasts had been an attack or not. 

In <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1996" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the past three years</TIMEX2>, scores of bankers and executives and several 
politicians have been murdered in Russia in suspected mafia-related 
attacks.
