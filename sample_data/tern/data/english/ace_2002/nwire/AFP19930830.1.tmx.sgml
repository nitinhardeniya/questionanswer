    MOSCOW, <TIMEX2 val="1993-08-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Aug 30</TIMEX2> (AFP) - A Greek businessman has been killed in a carbomb 
explosion outside a Moscow hotel where he was staying, police said <TIMEX2 val="1993-08-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>. 

The man was identified as N. Lapidis, director general of the firm Sparta. 

Police said the theory that the car's owner, who was deputy manager of the Hotel 
Belgrade, might have been victim of a settling of scores was "one of the 
hypotheses under consideration" in the explosion which happened on <TIMEX2 val="1993-08-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>. 

The Greek was the only victim of the attack which occurred outside the Belgrade. 

On <TIMEX2 val="1993-08-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, another explosion occurred at <TIMEX2 val="1993-08-29TMO" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">dawn</TIMEX2> in front of the apartment of 
Sergei Belashov, a member of Moscow's municipal council and a committee in 
charge of youth issues. Police said no one was injured in the explosion. 

Also <TIMEX2 val="1993-08-29" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Sunday</TIMEX2>, an anti-tank grenade was found tied to a pole on one of the rides 
in the Gorky amusement park in central Moscow. Police called to the scene were 
able to defuse the grenade. 

Attacks among organised criminals in Moscow have claimed more than 22 lives in 
<TIMEX2 val="P2M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1993-08" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">the last two months</TIMEX2>, according to figures published by the <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-WXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">weekly</TIMEX2> Moscow News.
