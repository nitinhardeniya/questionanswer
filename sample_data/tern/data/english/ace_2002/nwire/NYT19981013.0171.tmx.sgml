NEW YORK _ The potato ricer has survived into <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the age of the
food processor</TIMEX2>. And it has the starch content of the potato to
thank. The food processor's blade slices open too many of its
starchy cells, and what you end up with is not a silky potato
puree, but a sticky, gluey, unpleasant mess.
So the potato ricer remains the only way to get a perfectly
smooth potato puree.
Most potato ricers look like large garlic presses. The boiled
potato sits in a cylinder or V-shaped receptacle, and the handles
are squeezed together to push the potato through a plate punched
with small round holes. This crushes the potato into shapes varying
from small grains of rice to strands the thickness of yarn,
depending on the ricer.
Some starch is released when this is done, but not enough to
make the resulting puree tight and gluey. Once riced, the potatoes
can be placed back into a pan and heated gently while you stir in
cream, butter, olive oil, herbs, or whatever you like.
All five potato ricers I tested produced fine pureed potato, but
some did it with more ease than others.
I began with the monster: the Admiral Craft V ricer. Large and
industrial, it looks more suitable for a cafeteria kitchen than a
home. I thought it might have some advantages for <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="holiday">Thanksgiving</TIMEX2>. I
was wrong.
There is a hook on the ricer end so you can position it on the
edge of a bowl. The idea is good. But this thing is so heavy and
you have to press so hard that it slips all over the place, bowl
and all.
The other frustration is that, despite its size and solidity, I
could rice only one potato at a time. You would need to have
Schwarzenegger forearms to handle two or more potatoes. If that's
your build and you eat A LOT of mashed potatoes, this ricer is sold
at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome St., (Wooster Street), (212)
966-3434, for $47.95.
SCI Cuisine International makes a ricer almost identical to the
Admiral Craft, but smaller and without the bowl hook.
It rices potatoes into tiny little shreds, but the handle has
such hard edges that your hand suffers through the entire process.
And the flat part that presses the potato against the holes does
not press it far enough, so you are left with a layer of flattened
potato in the ricer after each potato.
Its best attribute is that it's a bargain, just $9.95 at
Broadway Panhandler. Personally, I'd rather pay for comfort.
Which is why I was interested in Williams-Sonoma's Metaltex
potato ricer. It is made of plastic, which makes it comfortable in
the hand, and it has three ricer plates, each with different-size
holes. The plates are held in place by a plastic cylinder that fits
snugly inside the main cylinder; I would have preferred it without
this extra part to wash.
In addition, most potatoes require a lot of force to rice, and
when using this plastic ricer, I could feel its potential to crack.
Which is not what I want to feel when I am paying $12 for it. It is
available by mail-order at (800) 541-2233.
Far superior to the first three was the aluminum Simplex 2
Dischi potato ricer. Though there is no bowl hook or support, the
handles are rounded so that even when you press hard, it is easy to
hold.
This ricer comes with two plates, one with small holes the size
of sesame seeds and one with larger ones the size of peppercorns.
It costs $11.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street), (212)
787-2000. It was a pleasure to use, rather than an ordeal.
Comfort, ease of use and quality all came together in the Oxo
potato ricer. The handles, padded with black rubber, were gentle on
the hands. There are no interchangeable plates, so the cylinder
holding the potato is one solid piece and is easy to clean.
Potatoes riced through the tiny holes came out like spaghetti,
and because it is so solid, keeping control of it was effortless.
It is sold for $19.95 at Broadway Panhandler and at a Cook's
Companion, 152 Atlantic Ave., Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, (718)
852-6641.
