Israel Seen as Paradise for Money Laundering

JERUSALEM -- Summoned to a downtown bank <TIMEX2 val="2000-01" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last month</TIMEX2>, the police 
arrested a woman who they suspected was laundering profits for foreign 
racketeers. A native of Chechnya, she had reportedly tried to open an 
Israeli account with $50 million in Venezuelan checks in the name of 
an apparently fictitious Gibraltar investment firm. 

If so, it would not have been the first time Israel had attracted 
professional money-scrubbers. 

In <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-02" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent months</TIMEX2>, the authorities have been asked to investigate cash 
transfers linked to a $340 million insider-trading deal involving a 
Russian telecommunications company and to the huge money laundering 
scandal involving the Bank of New York. <TIMEX2 val="1999-SU" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Last summer</TIMEX2>, the conviction of 
an Israeli crime boss in Miami for running a money laundering business 
for the cartel in Cali, Colombia, prompted renewed concern about the 
recycling of cocaine money here. 

But the police and prosecutors here face an almost insurmountable 
problem: Money laundering is not a crime in Israel. 

Although that may be about to change, <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-02-21" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">right now</TIMEX2> Israel does not make 
it illegal to bank or spend the proceeds of illicit offshore 
enterprises. As a nation founded as a safe haven for Jews, there is a 
longstanding tradition of welcoming immigrants and their assets. Banks 
and brokerages are not obligated to verify the provenance of a 
customer's investment funds. Reporting requirements for new accounts 
are minimal, as are the penalties for a failure to comply with those 
rules. 

"Israel is a paradise for money laundering, because it is not against 
the law," said Cmdr. Yossi Sedbon, head of the investigative division 
of Israel's national police. "I don't know if it is really that big a 
business here. But millions come in and go out, and you can't do 
anything about it." 

Many families here fled nations that prohibited them from expatriating 
their money; those who managed to circumvent such restrictions were 
applauded, not interrogated. Immigrants from the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-02-21" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> Soviet Union 
brought an estimated $2.5 billion to Israel in <TIMEX2 val="199" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the 1990's</TIMEX2>, much of it 
from foreign accounts their home countries had restricted. Israel was 
not about to enforce <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Soviet-era</TIMEX2> capital controls or question the 
legality of those transfers. 

But those policies have been systematically exploited by sophisticated 
international criminal networks, the authorities here say. 
"If you want to get an Israeli passport and then go all over the 
world, it is very easy," Commander Sedbon said. "You need a Jewish 
mother, but if you don't have one, you can create one." 
Informed estimates of money laundering by organized crime groups here 
in <TIMEX2 val="199" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the last decade</TIMEX2> range from the hundreds of millions of dollars to 
the billions, with income from foreign tax evasion and business 
kickbacks increasing the figures. 

Even if the authorities could prove that funds transferred here were 
the fruit of fraud or theft or narcotics sales, they could not -- as 
is often done in the United States and Europe -- seize the money or 
property bought with it. To prosecute, they must demonstrate that 
crimes were also committed in Israel. Even then, the money is usually 
off limits except for the payment of penalties. 

Compounding law enforcement difficulties are Israel's strict secrecy 
laws on local bank accounts. Restrictions on accounts abroad, 
meanwhile, have been largely abolished. Israelis are no longer 
required to report offshore deposits of less than $5 million, and new 
immigrants need not report any foreign holdings. Millions can be wired 
from a citizen's foreign account to a local bank without facing any 
special reporting requirements. 

In <TIMEX2 val="1988" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1988</TIMEX2>, Israel signed an international convention in Vienna banning 
drug money laundering, but it could not be ratified in Parliament 
because Israeli law was not in compliance with the treaty. 
Since <TIMEX2 val="1988" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">then</TIMEX2>, a few legislators and Justice Ministry professionals have 
pushed unsuccessfully to make money laundering a crime. 
Russian immigrant leaders have complained that their people felt 
unfairly targeted. The politically powerful banks fought regulation, 
and advocates of continuing Jewish immigration worried that stringent 
financial reporting might discourage others. 

<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-02-21" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">Now</TIMEX2>, however, legislators say chances are good that a bill will pass 
<TIMEX2 val="2000" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>. 

"We are trying to resolve the conflicts of interest involved -- the 
right of the police to investigate, and the right of the citizen to 
privacy," said Tsipi Livni, a member of the opposition Likud Party who 
heads the committee writing the antilaundering bill. "But I am very 
concerned. When the chief of police speaks about billions, I think it 
is a problem." 

As drafted, the legislation would adopt American-style reporting 
requirements for most banking and stock market transactions, as well 
as procedures for confiscating assets and prosecuting bankers. 
But foreign tax evasion would not be considered a crime, Ms. Livni 
said. 

Nor would the legislation impose the reporting requirements on 
Israel's $5 billion-<TIMEX2 val="XXXX" mod="" set="YES" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a-year</TIMEX2> diamond trade, conducted traditionally on 
the basis of cash and handshakes. 

Those omissions worry some. "Israel is facing a problem of organized 
crime and probably, though I don't have evidence of it, of links 
between organized crime and the diamond industry," said Patrick 
Moulette, who heads an antilaundering task force for the 29-nation 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris. 

Officials at Israel's Diamond Exchange vigorously deny that their 
business has been exploited by money laundering gangs, even though 
some local organized crime figures -- including Eli Tisona, the 
convicted Florida investment counselor for Colombia's drug lords -- 
have also been prominent gem dealers. 

But the decision not to penalize foreign tax infractions may prove 
more significant. Most of the dirty money washed clean by Israeli 
banks stems not from narcotics or protection rackets, but from 
off-the-books business deals, said Menachem Amir, a criminologist at 
Hebrew University. "It is black money, but is mostly income tax 
evasion, not drug money," he said. 

In <TIMEX2 val="PXM" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="2000-02" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">recent months</TIMEX2>, several figures implicated in the Bank of New York 
money laundering scandal and in a web of obscure financial 
institutions abroad have been found to hold Israeli passports and to 
maintain homes here, although they reside and operate in Russia or 
Europe. 

Commander Sedbon says he believes that some fraction of the money 
siphoned out of Moscow ended up in Israel. But he says it is difficult 
to quantify. 

After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emigration of most Jews 
from the Islamic Middle East and North Africa, Israel can now afford 
to tighten financial rules for immigrants, Professor Amir says. 
But there is still resistance. <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Two years ago</TIMEX2>, Gregory Lerner, an 
immigrant businessman, acknowledged in court that he had defrauded 
Russian banks of $48 million and used the money to try to start a bank 
here. He was fined $5 million and sentenced to <TIMEX2 val="P6Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="can't be sure of the anchoring date. I doubt it was the date he acknowledged the crime, 1998.">six years in prison</TIMEX2> -- 
not for bringing in stolen money, but for resorting to bribery, 
blackmail and fraud in local dealings. Though he admitted guilt, his 
conviction was criticized by some Russian immigrant leaders, who 
contended he was unjustly punished for offenses elsewhere. 
With expected good-behavior sentence reductions, Mr. Lerner is likely 
to be released <TIMEX2 val="2001" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">next year</TIMEX2>. He will then be allowed to enjoy his 
fortune, which the Israeli authorities cannot touch. Extradition back 
to Russia, even if Moscow so requested, would be difficult legally, 
and unthinkable politically.
