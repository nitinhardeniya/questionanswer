Lawmaker vows to stop shopping festival, brands it morally corrupt

KUWAIT (AP) _ A fundamentalist Muslim lawmaker has vowed to stop
a shopping festival planned in <TIMEX2 val="1999-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">February</TIMEX2>, saying a stagnant economy
cannot be improved by singers and moral corruption, a newspaper
reported <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-28" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2>.
Organizers from private and public sectors have said the
shop-till-you-drop extravaganza would feature music concerts and
dance troupes, a rarity in this conservative Muslim country.
Several religious organizations have criticized the planned
event as a cause for corruption. Music concerts in Kuwait need to
be approved by authorities, and when they are, audiences are
forbidden from dancing.
The festival, the first of its kind in Kuwait, is aimed at
giving an economy ailing from low oil prices a shot in the arm.
``National economy cannot be activated by a singer from here,
and a singer from there,'' Parliament member Muabarak al-Duwailah
said in comments published by Al-Watan daily.
Al-Duwailah said fundamentalists will continue to pressure the
government to intervene and cancel the festival, al-Watan reported.
If government ministers do not cooperate, Islamists will have to
take other steps, al-Duwailah said. He did not elaborate.
Fundamentalists form the second largest bloc in the non-partisan
50-member Parliament, after government supporters.
