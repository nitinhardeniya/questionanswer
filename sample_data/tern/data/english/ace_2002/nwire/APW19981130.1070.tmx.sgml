Britain taps cyber character Lara Croft as scientific ambassador

LONDON (AP) _ She's got big guns, and <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-30T14:53" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> she's got a title.
A British government official said <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2> he wants Lara Croft _
the scantily clad, heavily armed heroine of the popular ``Tomb
Raider'' computer game _ to be an ``ambassador'' for the nation's
science and technology.
Science Minister Lord Sainsbury cited the British-created cyber
character as he chided people for harking back too much to
Britain's historical inventions.
Britain needed to show it was the home of people like Professor
Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge theoretical physicist who wrote ``A
Brief History of Time,'' and vacuum cleaner pioneer Dyson, and
discoveries including Dolly the cloned sheep and optical fibers,
Sainsbury said in a speech at the Social Market Foundation in
London.
``I want Lara Croft to be an ambassador for British scientific
excellence,'' he said.
The Trade and Industry Department said Sainsbury was using the
Croft character as an example of modern British innovations for
which he wanted Britain to be known, in place of the traditional
``cream teas and steam engines'' picture.
