   When President Boris N. Yeltsin announced <TIMEX2 val="1994-W23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last week</TIMEX2> that he was preparing an 
urgent decree that would finally reckon with Russia's powerful mobsters -- 
"criminal filth" he called them -- the nation was delighted. 

When he released the decree <TIMEX2 val="1994-W24-X" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored">a few days later</TIMEX2>, after <TIMEX2 val="1994-W23-WE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a weekend in which the 
Moscow police said there were nearly a dozen bombings and at least eight 
contract killings in the capital alone</TIMEX2>, it seemed that nothing would be more 
welcome. 

Then people began to read the document, which suspends some of the country's 
newest and most basic civil liberties. It permits police to detain people almost 
at will, for instance, and to search homes, offices and cars without any 
evidence that a crime has been committed. From <TIMEX2 val="1994-W24-X" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored - time of release of decree">then</TIMEX2> on there has been an 
avalanche of outrage here, as leaders across the political spectrum, including 
some of Mr. Yeltsin's strongest supporters, have denounced the decree with a 
unanimity rarely seen in Russia. 

"By permitting police to arrest suspected criminals and hold them for <TIMEX2 val="P1M" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a month</TIMEX2> 
without having to answer a question, this decree raises doubts about the most 
fundamental principles of civilized law," said Boris Zolotyukhin, a leading 
human rights activist here and an author of the new Constitution that Mr. 
Yeltsin campaigned for so vigorously in <TIMEX2 val="1993-12" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">December</TIMEX2>. "Existing laws, if they were 
actually implemented, would be just as effective in stopping crime." 

Even the head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-06-19" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> K.G.B., 
acknowledged that the decree would do damage to civil liberties. "Will there be 
violations of human rights?" said Sergei V. Stepashin, the counterintelligence 
chief. "Probably, yes. But only in the interest of 99 percent of the remaining 
population." 
  
Stalin's Terror Recalled 

Russians have heard a similar line before, and <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-06-19" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">not so long ago</TIMEX2>. Critics have 
lined up to note that Stalin's mass terror began with simplified court and 
police procedures. The repression was declared by the Bolshevik leaders to be in 
the interest of the vast majority of the population, and it led to the deaths of 
millions. 

Nobody is suggesting -- or really even thinking -- that Mr. Yeltsin means to 
suspend civil rights as a first step toward something more horrific. But 
ignoring the Constitution and granting the police nearly absolute powers, even 
in a crime wave that challenges the foundation of this tenuous new democracy, is 
still a profoundly unsettling prospect here. 

For <TIMEX2 val="PXCE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="19" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">centuries</TIMEX2> Russians have lived, and often died, by the axiom that "to raze a 
forest, splinters need to fly." But for a majority of people, whose fear of 
crime and gangsters cannot be overstated, it has always seemed like a deal far 
too often won by the devil. The idea of rolling back <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-06-19" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> laws -- the new 
Constitution says the police can hold suspects without charges <TIMEX2 val="PT48H" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">only 48 hours</TIMEX2>, 
for instance, not <TIMEX2 val="P30D" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">30 days</TIMEX2>, and it requires that the police obtain court orders 
before they enter and search a building -- frightens Russians on a very basic 
level. 

"I am convinced that society will accept the most brutal measures in the 
struggle against crime," Aleksandr Mikhailov, a senior counterintelligence 
official, told reporters <TIMEX2 val="1994-W24" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this week</TIMEX2>. 

Polls repeatedly suggest that crime has become the greatest fear for most 
residents of big Russian cities, like Moscow and St. Petersburg. Bombs, 
assassinations, hijackings and far more pervasive though subtler criminal 
activity like bribery and corruption have become facts of life. 
  
5,600 Gangs in Russia 

On <TIMEX2 val="1994-06-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, the Interior Ministry released a raft of new statistics, clearly 
intended to remind people why the decree was issued: More than 5,600 gangland 
groups are operating <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-06-19" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> in Russia, almost 10 times the number in <TIMEX2 val="1990" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1990</TIMEX2>; in <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="does this mean the last 12 months ending recently, or last year?">the 
last year</TIMEX2> more than $70 billion worth of merchandise was confiscated from 
criminals; nearly 25,000 crimes were committed with firearms <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last year</TIMEX2>, and <TIMEX2 val="1994-06-19" mod="BEFORE" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-01-01" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">so 
far this year</TIMEX2> homicides have increased by nearly 50 percent in the capital. 

But Mr. Mikhailov is apparently wrong when he says that Russians will put up 
with anything to counteract this crime wave. As much as most people here want to 
reduce the grip gangs have taken on nearly every aspect of commercial and 
political life, they may not be willing to throw out their most bitterly won new 
rights to do it. 

"Every time Russia has tried to do something for the greater good of the state," 
the newspaper Izvestia noted on <TIMEX2 val="1994-06-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, "it has ended in political terror and 
dictatorship and extraordinary powers in the hands of extraordinary bodies." 

A draft resolution circulated in Parliament on <TIMEX2 val="1994-06-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, charging that the 
President had violated the law and the Constitution by imposing such a sweeping 
new measure, although discussion was postponed until <TIMEX2 val="1994-W25" mod="START" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">early next week</TIMEX2>. In 
Parliament, only Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ardent nationalist who has 
suggested executing criminals suspected of gang involvement, has supported the 
new decree. 
  
A Dangerous Position 

And in bypassing Parliament, invoking powers that he almost certainly does not 
possess, and in appealing to people's nearly bottomless fear of crime, Mr. 
Yeltsin has put himself in a dangerous position. He has given his opposition 
what they want most: evidence that he is more of a dictator than a democrat. He 
has alienated his most liberal supporters by ranging too far in his quest for 
law and order, and he may have done it all in vain. 

For few people believe that this decree, which goes beyond even many of the 
harshest and most abused laws of <TIMEX2 val="" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the Soviet era</TIMEX2>, will work as intended. 

It grants the police the right to detain people suspected of involvement in 
organized crime for <TIMEX2 val="P30D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">up to 30 days</TIMEX2> without charges or bail, permits officials to 
root through the bank accounts of anyone suspected of criminal involvement 
without a court order or approval and allows the police to use anything they 
obtain in these searches in court. There is even a provision that permits the 
authorities to investigate anyone who has lived with a suspect for <TIMEX2 val="P5Y" mod="MORE_THAN" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">more than 
five years</TIMEX2>. Russia's <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-06-19" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2> criminal code provides only for the use of evidence 
obtained in a search sanctioned by the court. 

Mr. Yeltsin's aides say the measure does not violate civil rights. "People's 
right to walk the streets without fear of crime is also a human right," Mikhail 
Yegorov, who is chief of the Interior Ministry's Organized Crime Department, 
told The Moscow Times <TIMEX2 val="1994-06-19" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">today</TIMEX2>. 
  
'Can't Do Anything About It' 

He said law enforcement officers were well aware of who the criminals are in 
Russia, "but in the framework of the existing criminal code, we can't do 
anything about it." He said that of 154 people condemned to death in Russia <TIMEX2 val="1993" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">last 
year</TIMEX2>, 149 had been pardoned. Only 19 percent of the more than 18,000 people 
found guilty of possessing firearms have been sent to jail, he said. 

The decree calls for major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg to prepare 
emergency plans of action; even the army may be called into combat the outlaws. 
Mr. Yeltsin flew back from the Russian Far East on <TIMEX2 val="1994-06-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2>, canceling a scheduled 
meeting with the Vietnamese Prime Minister, according to the news agency Tass, 
to concentrate on his crime plans. 

Yet he <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1994-06-19" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> stands in danger of obscuring the very problem the decree was created 
to combat. By transforming a consensus issue like law and order into a political 
battle between Parliament and the President, Mr. Yeltsin has already turned this 
into yet another test of his power. 

Even his staunchest opponents agree that would be unfortunate, because nobody 
doubts that what the country needs far more than another battle between the 
President and Parliament is a battle against crime and corruption.
