TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With his Cabinet debating the latest
Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured
skeptical hard-liners Thursday he would walk away from the deal if
he feels the Palestinians are not keeping their commitments.
After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet met for over 13 hours
Thursday to approve the land-for-peace agreement with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu's office said the cabinet would reconvene
Friday at 9:00 am (0700 gmt) to continue debating the accord.
Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify
the accord, despite the vocal opposition of at least four and the
indecision of several others.
