VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A driver and his co-pilot taking part in
a local auto rally in Austria's Styria province were killed
Saturday when their Fiat Cinquecento veered off the course at a
curve, the Austria Press Agency reported.
The car of Bernhard Geramb, 35, and his companion Christian
Neuhold spun out of control at a point where the surface changed
from pavement to gravel. The two drivers died at the site of the
accident before being transported to a hospital.
The accident occurred near Selzthal in the southern Styria
province. The competition was suspended after the accident.
Geramb was an experienced pilot who took part in international
events this season, including the Monte Carlo Rally, APA said.
It was the second fatal accident in an Austrian auto rally event
this season. During a race on May 9, two German competitors were
killed when their car collided with a wall.
