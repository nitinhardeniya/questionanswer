   A <TIMEX2 val="P24Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1983" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">24-year-old</TIMEX2> emigre from the Soviet Union was found shot to death <TIMEX2 val="1983-02-05" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> 
in the doorway of a commercial building in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. The 
police said <TIMEX2 val="1983-02-06" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">yesterday</TIMEX2> that the motive for the crime was unclear. 

They said they doubted it was robbery because the victim, Victor Malinsky of 
Floral Park, Queens, was wearing gold chains and a diamond ring and had $265 in 
his wallet. He was also carrying a paging device, which was beeping when 
officers arrived at the scene at <TIMEX2 val="1983-02-05T05:30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">5:30 A.M.</TIMEX2> 

Mr. Malinsky was shot in the head, chest and back, the police said. The body was 
found at the entrance to 601 West 26th Street, between 11th and 12th Avenues, by 
the building's <TIMEX2 val="TNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">night</TIMEX2> watchman. 

Mr. Malinsky, a self-employed interior decorator, arrived from the Soviet Union 
in <TIMEX2 val="1980" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1980</TIMEX2> and lived at 270-15A Grand Central Parkway, according to the police. 

They said they had not determined whether the victim was slain at the Chelsea 
site or slain elsewhere.
