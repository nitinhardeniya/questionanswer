    Six people were killed in a night of crime-related violence in Moscow, 
including one in a cafe shootout, the Tass news agency said Monday. 

Anatoly Kalinin, the police duty supervisor, told Tass there were 35 incidents 
of robbery and burglary and 25 cars stolen during the night. Four murder 
suspects were arrested and seven people suspected of theft were taken into 
custody, he said. 

In one incident, Tass said, a fight involving guns and a grenade left one person 
dead and a foreigner wounded at a cooperative restaurant. 

"Fighting broke out between customers during a party for Soviet and U.S. cooking 
experts at the cafe," Tass said. It did not identify the wounded foreigner or 
give his nationality. The dead man, who was not immediately identified, was a 
director of a Moscow technical school, the news agency said. 

The Americans were not further identified, and the U.S. Embassy was closed for 
the Columbus Day holiday. 

As the economy crumbles, crime in the Soviet capital has been on the increase. 

Last summer the Interior Ministry, which oversees the police department, 
reported more than 3,000 crimes involving firearms in the first six months of 
1991. 

Eduard Kalachev, head of the ministry's department of public order, said crime 
was on the increase. He said there are nearly 4.7 million legally registered 
firearms in the country of 289 million. He did not give figures for illegally 
held weapons. 

In February, the ministry said Soviet police arrested 2.8 million "criminals" in 
1990, up 13 percent from the 1989 level of 2.5 million, and 40 percent above the 
1.6 million arrestred in 1986.
