    MOSCOW, Aug 30 (AFP) - A Greek businessman has been killed in a carbomb 
explosion outside a Moscow hotel where he was staying, police said Monday. 

The man was identified as N. Lapidis, director general of the firm Sparta. 

Police said the theory that the car's owner, who was deputy manager of the Hotel 
Belgrade, might have been victim of a settling of scores was "one of the 
hypotheses under consideration" in the explosion which happened on Friday. 

The Greek was the only victim of the attack which occurred outside the Belgrade. 

On Sunday, another explosion occurred at dawn in front of the apartment of 
Sergei Belashov, a member of Moscow's municipal council and a committee in 
charge of youth issues. Police said no one was injured in the explosion. 

Also Sunday, an anti-tank grenade was found tied to a pole on one of the rides 
in the Gorky amusement park in central Moscow. Police called to the scene were 
able to defuse the grenade. 

Attacks among organised criminals in Moscow have claimed more than 22 lives in 
the last two months, according to figures published by the weekly Moscow News.
