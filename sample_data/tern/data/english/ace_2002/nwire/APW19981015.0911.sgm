VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Australia's second-seed Patrick Rafter
moved into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP
tournament Thursday by ousting Magnus Norman of Sweden 6-3, 6-2.
``I match up well with someone like Magnus,'' Rafter said after
his victory.
Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, has a chance of replacing Pete
Sampras as the top-ranked player in the world in the coming weeks.
One step in this direction could be Friday's quarterfinal
encounter with Britain's Greg Rusedski, whose powerful serve
stunned local darling Thomas Muster, who is a far cry from his
onetime prowess.
Rafter, who has a 5-1 head-to-head record against Rusedski,
said, ``I never played Greg on this surface, and I do not know how
I will react to his serve.
``But I am confident there will be a couple of breaks here and
there,'' he added.
Rusedski, last year's finalist at the Vienna tournament, took 64
minutes to defeat Muster in straight sets 6-4, 6-3.
``It's always difficult to play Thomas in Austria,'' said the
Briton afterward. ``But I am very pleased that they did not let the
crowd getting into it.''
Asked what his chance was to qualify for the World Championship
in Hanover, Germany, Rusedski said, ``I think I still have a slight
chance, but the other guys in the top eight have solidified their
position.''
Earlier in the day, Todd Martin of the United States downed
fourth-seed Petr Korda of the Czech Republic.
Opening a day of second-round matches, the unseeded American
beat favored Korda 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
Fifth-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia then defeated Germany's
Tommy Haas 7-5, 6-4.
Haas' main problem was his weakness with the first service.
Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden subsequently subdued Bohdan Ulihrach of
the Czech Republic, 6-4, 6-1.
In the last singles of the day, eight-seed Tim Henman of Britain
fought back after being one set down to oust Swden's Thomas Enqvist
6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-3.
