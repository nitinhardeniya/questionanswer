ROME (AP) _ Police found a dilapidated freighter bearing about
400 illegal immigrants drifting off southeastern Italy on Saturday,
abandoned by its crew.
Six children and two women from the boat were taken to a
hospital for examination.
The first police to board the ship described the overall
condition of the refugees, most of them Kurds, as ``distressing,''
Italy's ANSA news service said.
The ship had been painted black to avoid detection. Italian
police found it about 400 meters (1,300 feet) off the very tip of
the Italian peninsula, its engines cut.
It was unclear how many days the refugees had been adrift.
Authorities said the refugees may have been trying to signal other
boats at the time they were found.
The immigrants were taken from the boat to a holding center.
Police were questioning them to find out the country from which the
boat left.
Authorities said favorable conditions at sea made for an
overnight influx of illegal refugees along the coast of Italy's
poor Puglia region, across the Adriatic from Albania and
Yugoslavia. Hundreds are believed to have come to shore; 200 or
more of them were stopped.
Interior Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino had gone to Albania on
Oct. 28 to promise more Italian assistance stopping the flow of
refugees.
She expressed frustration Saturday, saying, ``We had wished and
hoped that the phenomenon would in some way be contained and
stopped.''
