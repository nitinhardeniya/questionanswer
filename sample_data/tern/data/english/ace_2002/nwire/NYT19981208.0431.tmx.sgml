HARTFORD, Conn. _ A growing number of legislators may be
frowning or squirming, but a sea of pompom-waving grade-schoolers
and their parents gave Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England
Patriots, a boisterous welcome <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> as he arrived here to
bolster support for a state-subsidized football stadium.
Kraft brought along five Patriots players to sign autographs for
young people at a charity event for the Pop Warner youth football
program. And he also brought checks to the Pop Warner league and to
a Connecticut organization for urban youth, called Leadership,
Education and Athletics in Partnership.
In an interview later, Kraft said he was not overly concerned
about the growing skepticism among some Connecticut lawmakers about
the stadium deal he negotiated with Gov. John Rowland. ``I want
there to be a good dialogue, and I want people to feel this is the
right thing for the community, and if they don't, then we shouldn't
come,'' Kraft said. ``This has got to be a two-way partnership to
work.''
Kraft is likely to encounter some of that skepticism firsthand
on <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> as he goes before the Connecticut General Assembly for
a <TIMEX2 val="P1DT" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-12-09" anchor_dir="WITHIN" comment="Is a daylong meeting really one day long? or just a daytime event?">daylong</TIMEX2> public hearing on the tentative agreement. Kraft said he
was impressed that the Connecticut Legislature had committed
millions of dollars to rebuilding Hartford even without the team,
and said he hopes to make rejuvenating the city an important part
of his legacy.
``We want to be part of this city and want to be involved off
the field, putting private capital at risk to help revitalize the
city,'' he said.
Although Kraft said he planned to continue his charitable
commitments in the Boston area and would continue to live there, he
promised to bring his philanthropy to Hartford, especially in the
areas of youth football and youth development.
``An NFL franchise is like no other business, because it has an
ability to touch a community and make the community feel good,'' he
said in the interview. ``If you love your family and you love your
community and your team is an extension of that, you take pride
when your family does well.''
A poll released <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-08" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Tuesday</TIMEX2> by Quinnipiac College indicated that
Connecticut residents welcome the team but are concerned about the
cost. Those polled supported Rowland's plan by 51 percent to 39
percent. But the respondents said it is too generous to the
Patriots, by 49 percent to 31 percent.
The poll, which has a margin of sampling error of 3.1 percent,
included 988 state residents and was conducted <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> through
<TIMEX2 val="1998-12-07" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Monday</TIMEX2>.
