MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada took the
first step <TIMEX2 val="1998-11-27" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> toward changing the <TIMEX2 val="P11Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="">11-year-old</TIMEX2> constitution,
written after the ouster of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, by
creating a commission to study possible amendments.
In a presidential order, Estrada created a commission that will
recommend changes to the <TIMEX2 val="1987" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1987</TIMEX2> constitution, saying it needs to be
``attuned to the heartbeat of the times.''
The commission was told to complete its work by <TIMEX2 val="1999-06-30" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">June 30, 1999</TIMEX2>.
It will be composed of up to 25 people, including three retired
members of the Supreme Court and the heads of the committees on
constitutional amendments of the Senate and the House of
Representatives.
Constitutional amendments can be proposed by a vote of
two-thirds of the members of Congress or by an elected
constitutional convention. The proposed amendments or revisions
must be approved in a plebiscite.
The constitution, ratified in <TIMEX2 val="1987" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1987, <TIMEX2 val="1987" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="event anchored - coref with 1987">a year after Marcos' ouster</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>,
limits presidents to a single <TIMEX2 val="P6Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">six-year</TIMEX2> term to prevent
dictatorships.
Many groups, including Roman Catholic Church leaders, have
opposed attempts to open the charter to changes in <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-27T05:35" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">the past</TIMEX2>,
fearing this could endanger its democratic provisions.
Estrada said <TIMEX2 val="1998-W48" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">earlier this week</TIMEX2> that he wants to change a clause
that prohibits foreigners from owning land in the Philippines
because it discourages investors and prevents the development of
idle land.
He also favors changes that would provide for senators to be
elected by region instead of nationally to assure more
representation for provinces.
A <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-27T05:35" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="">former</TIMEX2> town mayor, Estrada favors increasing the <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-11-27T05:35" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">current</TIMEX2>
maximum three <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">three-year</TIMEX2> terms for local officials to three
<TIMEX2 val="P4Y" mod="" set="" non_specific="YES" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">four-year</TIMEX2> terms, saying that would allow officials to accomplish
more.
