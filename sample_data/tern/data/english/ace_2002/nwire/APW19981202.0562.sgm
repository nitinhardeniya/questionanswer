BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former 5,000-meter world
record-holder David Moorcroft on Wednesday was named chief
executive of UK Athletics, the new governing body of track and
field in Britain.
Moorcroft has been been running the organization on an interim
basis following the financial collapse last year of the British
Athletics Federation.
Moorcroft's appointment was expected and one of the first acts
of former Olympic hurdles champion David Hemery, who was elected
last month as the new president.
One of Moorcroft's long-term challenges will be to lure the
World Championships to London in 2003, with a revamped Wembley
Stadium as the venue.
The IAAF, the governing body of world track and field, said last
month it was considering awarding the 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009
worlds at the same time. In no particular order, London, Paris,
Tokyo and Berlin are expected to be the sites.
