JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's highest court
ruled <TIMEX2 val="1998-12-02" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Wednesday</TIMEX2> it will hear an appeal by President Nelson Mandela
on a lower-court decision that quashed his probe of racism and
mismanagement in rugby.
In a country emerging from <TIMEX2 val="PXDE" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">decades of white rule</TIMEX2>, the case
resonates with racial issues. Blacks hated rugby _ loved by the
Afrikaner descendants of Dutch settlers _ as a symbol of the white
minority. Mandela tried to use rugby to unify the nation by
cheering on the national Springboks team to their World Cup victory
in <TIMEX2 val="1995" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">1995</TIMEX2>.
But racial divisions emerged again after Mandela appointed a
commission to investigate the South African Rugby Football Union,
the sport's ruling body.
SARFU went to court to block the probe and even hauled Mandela
into the witness stand. In <TIMEX2 val="1998-04" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">April</TIMEX2>, a judge on the High Court in
Pretoria, the capital, ruled Mandela had acted unconstitutionally
in appointing the commission.
High Court Judge William de Villiers, appointed to the bench
under the apartheid regime, even rebuked Mandela for alleged
insolence during his testimony.
The Constitutional Court voted unanimously to hear the appeal,
filed by lawyers for Mandela, Sports Minister Steve Tshwete and
Director-General of Sport Mthobi Tyamzashe.
The court set aside <TIMEX2 val="P5D" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1999-03-23" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="">five days</TIMEX2>, beginning on <TIMEX2 val="1999-03-23" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">March 23, 1999</TIMEX2>, for
the case.
