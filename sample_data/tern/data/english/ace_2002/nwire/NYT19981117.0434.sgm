NEW YORK _ The lawyer for a police officer charged with
attacking Abner Louima asked prosecutors Tuesday for details of a
lawsuit in which two men allege that Louima had filed fraudulent
claims with an insurance company.
The men claim they were dismissed by Country-Wide Insurance Co.
to keep them from disclosing information about Louima's claims,
which were related to injuries from a 1994 auto accident. A lawyer
for Country-Wide, Peter Panken, said there was ``nothing to cover
up'' and that the investigators had been dismissed for other
reasons.
In a request filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Marvyn
Kornberg, who represents Officer Justin Volpe, asked prosecutors
for the results of what he said had been questioning by the FBI of
the two men, Eldon DeSenso, who had worked as an investigator for
the company, and John Gonzales, who had supervised its
investigators. Their lawsuit makes no reference to any such
questioning.
The lawsuit, filed last week in Superior Court in Monmouth
County, N.J., quotes a company official as saying that Louima had
tried to make some insurance claims with Country-Wide and that the
company had disclaimed them. Alan Vinegrad, a prosecutor in the
Volpe case, declined to comment. A lawyer for Louima, Peter
Neufeld, did not return a phone call, but in the past he has said
that Louima, who alleged brutal attacks while in custody of New
York police, had received ``a few thousand dollars'' from the
claim.
