Government strikes asylum seeker camp after storm _ of criticism

ERMELO, Netherlands (AP) _ A controversial camp of army tents
housing asylum seekers on a windswept heath will be dismantled
after it provoked a storm of criticism that refugees were being
held in inhumane conditions.
But with the government struggling to find accommodation for a
growing flood of refugees, the campers will be moved from one set
of tents to another. Soldiers were <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> setting up a new camp _
with better tents _ near the eastern city of Nijmegen.
<TIMEX2 val="1998-W42" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Earlier this week</TIMEX2>, about 50 tents were pitched near Ermelo, a
town 60 kilometers (40 miles) east of Amsterdam. The camp, which
housed about 80 people under army and police guard, was equipped
with portable toilets and a single water tank.
The move was a public relations disaster for the government as a
heavy storm on <TIMEX2 val="1998-W42-XXTNI" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="a night earlier in the week.">the first night</TIMEX2> exposed leaky tents and turned the
heath into muddy marshland.
The new camp near Nijmegen is expected to open <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-17" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Saturday</TIMEX2> and
provide shelter for up to 900 people.
Through <TIMEX2 val="1998-09" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">September</TIMEX2>, 31,466 refugees have applied for permission
to stay in the Netherlands <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">this year</TIMEX2>. That's 30 percent more than
<TIMEX2 val="P9M" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1997-01" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="Presumably Jan-September 1997.">the same period <TIMEX2 val="1997" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">a year ago</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. By <TIMEX2 val="1998" mod="END" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">the end of the year</TIMEX2>, some officials
fear that number could swell to 50,000, creating a shortage of
space in Europe's most densely populated nation.
Dutch media also reported <TIMEX2 val="1998-10-16" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="" anchor_dir="" comment="">Friday</TIMEX2> that a Rwandan mother and her
two young children were dumped on the street by justice authorities
because they had no right to asylum in the Netherlands.
The family were the first victims of a tougher Dutch asylum
policy. Because the Hutus had come to the Netherlands by train from
Belgium, authorities <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" mod="" set="" non_specific="" anchor_val="1998-10-16T05:24:00" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="">now</TIMEX2> say they must apply for asylum there.
