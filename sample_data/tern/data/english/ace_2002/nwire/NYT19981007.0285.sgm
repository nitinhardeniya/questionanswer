CHICAGO _ In an unusual arrangement meant to encourage the
blurring of the distinction between genres, the Goodman Theater and
the Lyric Opera will collaborate on the development and production
of two new musical theater works, the two institutions announced
Wednesday.
Both William Mason, general director of Lyric, and Roche
Schulfer, executive director of the Goodman, said they believed
that such a partnership between an opera company and a theater
company was unprecedented.
The new pieces are being written under the auspices of the
Lyric's composer-in-residence program, by two young
composer-lyricists, Michael John LaChiusa and Adam Guettel. Neither
has written an opera (though LaChiusa has written librettos), but
both are known for adventurous, challenging musicals with ties to
contemporary classical music as well as contemporary show music.
Each project will be developed in workshops at the Lyric,
probably with singers from the Lyric's training program, and then
presented at the Goodman as part of its regular subscription
series. No budget has been set, but Mason said he expected each
project to cost ``in the mid-six figures.''
For the Lyric, the appeal of the collaboration is
cross-pollination, for the art forms and for the audiences, he
said. ``We need to expand the list of 20 or so box-office favorites
that any opera company needs to have on its schedule in order to
survive,'' he said, adding that for that to happen, the new works
have to appeal to a wide audience.
From the standpoint of the Goodman, which has produced 14
musicals, both revivals and new works, since 1986, the
collaboration provides a luxury that nonprofit theaters do not
often have. ``Time,'' Schulfer said. ``Developing new work these
days is a matter of finding time. Workshop time. Rehearsal time.
Revision time.''
LaChiusa, 36, has written for both Broadway and off-Broadway;
his musicals include ``Hello Again.'' The new piece, for which he
has a preliminary libretto, is about a poet coming to terms with
the influences of his friends and family on his work.
Guettel, 33, is best known for his musical ``Floyd Collins,''
which has had productions in Philadelphia and New York; the Goodman
will stage it next spring. He said he could not discuss the details
of his new project, because the rights to the story on which it is
based are not yet secure.
There is no timetable for either project, though Schulfer said
he hoped to be able to present both early in the new millennium _
not too long after the Goodman opens its new downtown theater,
currently scheduled for 2000. Asked if they were producing operas
or musicals, Mason and Schulfer said they did not know yet. ``Maybe
we'll create pieces that go to Broadway or maybe they'll go to the
Houston opera house,'' Schulfer said.
Mason added: ``We're starting out with no preconceived notion.
We're being so noble about this it's almost sickening.''
