    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    <p>This file contains documentation on the ACE Time Normalization (TERN) 2004 English Training Data V1.0, Linguistic
    Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2005T07 and isbn 1-58563-331-3.

    <p>This release contains the English training data prepared for the
2004 Time Expression Recognition and Normalization (TERN) Evaluation, 
sponsored by the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program.  The evaluation 
was held in August 2004 and a workshop in September 2004. Evaluation 
participants received this data for training purposes, and it is now being 
released for general use. 
<p>
The annotation specifications for this corpus were developed under DARPA's 
Translingual Information Detection Extraction and Summarization (TIDES) 
program, with continuing support from ACE.
<p>
The purpose of this corpus and the TERN evaluation is to advance the
state of the art in the automatic recognition and normalization of 
natural language temporal expressions.  In most language contexts such 
expressions are indexical.  For example, with "Monday", "last week", or 
"three months starting October 1", one must know the narrative reference 
time in order to pinpoint the time interval being conveyed by the expression.
In addition, for data exchange purposes, it is essential that the identified
interval be rendered according to an established standard, i.e., normalized.
Accurate identification and normalization of temporal expressions is in turn 
essential for the temporal reasoning being demanded by advanced NLP 
applications such as question answering, information extraction, and 
summarization.

    style="text-decoration:none">file.tbl</a> for the directory structure of
    this publication, as well as a complete list of files.


<p>All of the TERN data is text, and is grouped by individual directories 
according to each source type:
<ul>
  <li>bnews - Broadcast news data from the TDT-4 Corpus

  <li>nwire - Newswire data from the TDT-4 Corpus

  <li>npaper - Washington Post articles (ace_2002 only)

  <li>arabic_treebank - Data from the Arabic Treebank 1 Corpus 
    English translations from the MT-2003 translation data set

  <li>chinese_treebank - Data from the Chinese Treebank Version 4
   English translations from the Chinese Treebank English Parallel Text Corpus
</ul>

<p>This publication includes both the source data files in sgml format and the
annotated files, also in sgml format (*.tmx.sgml). 

<p>An md5sum list is provided in each data directory for validation purposes.

<p>This release of the TERN data contains only English language files.  The 2004 
TERN evaluation also made use of Chinese language files, but these are not 
being released at this time, pending further quality control procedures.
