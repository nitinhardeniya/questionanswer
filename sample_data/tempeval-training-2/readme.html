<p>In this document, we describe the Tempeval training data. The description focuses on
the English data, but the format for all other languages, with the exception of the French
data, is essentially the same. Available in this release is the second batch of training
data for Chinese, English, French, Italian, Korean and Spanish. The second batch includes
all data that was in the first batch. The main differences are: (i) more English data,
(ii) temporal links added to Italian and Spanish, and (iii) Korean data added.</p>

<p>The unavoidable updates to this document will be published on the Tempeval2 pages
at <a
href="http://www.timeml.org/tempeval2/">http://www.timeml.org/tempeval2/</a>,
which also contains a link to the Tempeval Google group.</p>

<h3>Data description</h3>

<p>Training data are given for six languages. Not all language provide data for all
tasks, below is a list with the contents of this distribution, the letters refer to the
tasks in the Tempeval proposal.</p>

<p>In addition, for French there is a small set of 3000 tokens with event, timex and
temporal link annotation, but the temporal links are not split into sub tasks.</p>

<p>The data are given in a set of vertical files with tab-separated rows. One file, named
"base-segmentation.tab", contains the tokenized text. The other files are (1) an optional
file with a lexical category for each token, (2) files with extents for events and timex3
tags, (3) files with attributes of events and timexes, and (4) files with temporal
relations. Below is a fragment of the file with the tokenized text (throughout, we use the
fragment "<i>... of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while...</i>" as an
example).</p>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	5	of
wsj_0037	27	6	an
wsj_0037	27	7	impudent
wsj_0037	27	8	American
wsj_0037	27	9	whom
wsj_0037	27	10	Sony
wsj_0037	27	11	hosted
wsj_0037	27	12	*T*-58
wsj_0037	27	13	for
wsj_0037	27	14	a
wsj_0037	27	15	year
wsj_0037	27	16	while
</pre>

<p>Each token is uniquely defined by a file name, a sentence offset and a token
offset. Both sentence offset and token offsets start at 0. For example, in the fragment
above, "impudent" is the eighth token in the 28th sentence of the file wsj_0037. The files
in this example were derived from the Penn treebank and contain the empty categories from
the Treebank, as with "*T*-58" above (note that this is actually an old description that
is relevant only for the trial data, the training data were not taken from the
Treebank). Some languages provide a file with lexical categories for each token, the
format is the same as the file with the tokens.</p>

<p>Events and their attributes are stored in two files:
"event-extents.tab" and "event-attributes.tab".</p>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1
</pre>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1	aspect	NONE
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1	modality	
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1	polarity	POS
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1	tense	PAST
</pre>

<p>Again, the first three columns uniquely identify a token position in the source. The
other columns of "event-extents.tab" contain the tag name (always "event" in this file),
the tag id, and the instance id. The tag id is unique to the file, and usually, but not
necessarily, unique to the corpus. The instance id is there to deal with cases like "She
plays soccer on Monday and Wednesday", where there are two instances of the "play soccer"
event. In the vast majority of cases, there is only one instance and the value in the last
column is "1". The file "event-attributes.tab" contains two more columns: an attribute
name and an attribute value.</p>

<p>Timexes and their attributes are stored in "timex-extents.tab" and
"timex-attributes.tab".</p>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	14	timex3	t2	1
wsj_0037	27	15	timex3	t2	1
</pre>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	14	timex3	t2	1	type	DURATION
wsj_0037	27	14	timex3	t2	1	value	P1Y
</pre>

<p>These files use the same columns as their eventive counter parts. But note that the
attributes are associated with the first token of the timex extent. Also note that the
instance number is always "1" for timexes.</p>

<p>The four classes of Tempeval temporal relations are all stored with the same
format. The associations between task identifier and file name are in the table below.</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr>
  <td>Task C</td>
  <td>tlinks-event-timex.tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Task D</td>
  <td>tlinks-dct-events.tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Task E</td>
  <td>tlinks-main-events.tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Task F</td>
  <td>tlinks-subordinated-events.tab</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The vertical files for the temporal relations all have four columns: (1) file name, (2)
tag id of the first element in the relation, (3) tag id of the second element in the
relation, and (4) the relation type.  Here is a fragment of "tlinks-event-time.tab", with
the temporal relation between "host" and "a year".</p>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	e561	t2	overlap
</pre>

<p>For Task D ("tlinks-dct-events.tab"), the third column is always "t0", where "t0" is a
special id that refers to the Document Creation Time. Note that the exact value of the DCT
is not specified in the file with timexes since it is not necessarily associated with an
offset, instead, the DCT timex is given for each file in a separate file named
"dct.tab".</p>


<a name="annotation"></a>
<h3>Annotation process</h3>

<p>Annotation of the trial data proceeded in several phases:</p>

<ol>
<li>Annotation of event and timex extents</li>
<li>Annotation of event and timex attributes</li>
<li>Annotation of temporal links</li>
</ol>

<p>The output of phase 1 was input to phases 2 and 3. For each phase, dual annotation
followed by an adjudication phase was used. Annotators were given several documents to
guide them in their tasks. What documents were used is language specific, see the docs
directory for each language for guidelines and other documentation. Some documentation is
still forthcoming.</p>

<a name="browser"></a>
<h3>Browsing the data</h3>

<p>The tabular data format is rather uninviting for manual inspection, therefore, we
created HTML dumps for all tables. Links are available in the list below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="chinese/html/index.html">Chinese</a>
<li><a href="english/html/index.html">English</a>
<li><a href="italian/html/index.html">Italian</a>
<li><a href="korean/html/index.html">Korean</a>
<li><a href="spanish/html/index.html">Spanish</a>
</ul>

<p>There is no browser for French because the French data are in XML format and can be
viewed as is. Note that the Italian data give a glimpse into some of the temporal
relations even though those relations are not part of this official release. Consider
this a sneak preview on the final data delivery.</p>



<a name="future"></a>
<h3>Evaluation data</h3>


<p>The evaluation data will be held out from the entire corpus, but otherwise be identical
in format to the training data. However, depending on the task some data will be left
out:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr valign="top">
  <td>Tasks A and B</td>
  <td>Only the file "base-segmentation.tab" will be provided. The task
  would be to create the files "timex-extents.tab",
  "timex-attributes.tab", "event-extents.tab", and
  "event-attributes.tab".</td> 
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td>Tasks&nbsp;C&nbsp;through&nbsp;F</td>
  <td>All files will be provided, but the relation types in the files
  with temporal links will be set to "NONE". The task here is to
  replace "NONE" with one of the acceptable relation types.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The evaluation data will be released on March 28th. Scorer scripts will be made
available on the Tempeval website before March 21st.</p>



<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Language-specific remarks</h3>

<p>The French data are not provided as vertical files, but as XML files. Likewise, the
evaluation data for French will be in XML format.</p>

<p>The Document Creation Time is given in listings in the data directory for three
languages: Chinese, English and Spanish. For French the DCT is given as a timex inside the
XML document where the attribute functionInDocument has value PUBLICATION_TIME, in most
cases, the DCT is also reflected in the file name. For Italian, the DCT is typically given
as the first timex in each document, marked with t1. There are a couple of exceptions
though:</p>

<ul>
<li>cs.morph015 and cs.morph016 have as DCT 1995-08-07T18:00; signaled by t0
<li>els.morph041 has as DCT 1986-09-30T18:00; signaled by t0
<li>els.morph042 has as DCT 1986-09-29T18:00; signaled by t0
</ul>
