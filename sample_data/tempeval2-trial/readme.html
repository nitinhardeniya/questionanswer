<p>In this document, we describe the English trial data. The format
for all other languages is essentially the same, although small
differences are possible. Available in this release are the trial data
for English and Italian. </p>

<p>Updates to this document will be published on the Tempeval2 pages
at <a
href="http://www.timeml.org/tempeval2/tempeval2-trial/">http://www.timeml.org/tempeval2/tempeval2-trial/</a>.</p>


<a name="description"></a>
<h3>Data description</h3>

<p>The trial data are given in a set of vertical files with
tab-separated rows. One file, named "base-segmentation.tab", contains
the tokenized text. The other files are (1) a file with a lexical
category for each token, (2) files with extents for events and timex3
tags, (3) files with attributes of events and timexes, and (4) files
with temporal relations. Below is a fragment of the file with the
tokenized text (throughout, we use the fragment "<i>... of an impudent
American whom Sony hosted for a year while...</i>" as an example).</p>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	5	of
wsj_0037	27	6	an
wsj_0037	27	7	impudent
wsj_0037	27	8	American
wsj_0037	27	9	whom
wsj_0037	27	10	Sony
wsj_0037	27	11	hosted
wsj_0037	27	12	*T*-58
wsj_0037	27	13	for
wsj_0037	27	14	a
wsj_0037	27	15	year
wsj_0037	27	16	while
</pre>

<p>Each token is uniquely defined by a filename, a sentence offset and a
token offset. Both sentence offset and token offsets start at 0. For
example, in the fragment above, "impudent" is the eighth token in the
28th sentence of the file wsj_0037. The files in this sample are
derived from the Penn treebank and contain the empty categories from
the Treebank, as with "*T*-58" above.</p>

<!--
<p>The "lex-categories.tab" file assigns lexical categories to each
token. This file is may be useful because, for event recognition in
English, we will report results for each major lexical category. For
English, the lexical categories are derived from the part-of-speech
tags from the Treebank. Below is the slice of the file where lexical
categories are assigned to the tokens in our running example.</p>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037        27      5       prep
wsj_0037        27      6       other
wsj_0037        27      7       adj
wsj_0037        27      8       noun
wsj_0037        27      9       other
wsj_0037        27      10      noun
wsj_0037        27      11      verb
wsj_0037        27      12      trace
wsj_0037        27      13      prep
wsj_0037        27      14      other
wsj_0037        27      15      noun
wsj_0037        27      16      prep
</pre>
-->

<p>Events and their attributes are stored in two files:
"event-extents.tab" and "event-attributes.tab".</p>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1
</pre>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1	aspect	NONE
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1	modality	
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1	polarity	POS
wsj_0037	27	11	event	e561	1	tense	PAST
</pre>

<p>Again, the first three columns uniquely identify a token position
in the source. The other columns of "event-extents.tab" contain the
tag name (always "event" in this file), the tag id, and the instance
id. The tag id is unique to the file, and usually, but not
necessarily, unique to the corpus. The instance id is there to deal
with cases like "She plays soccer on Monday and Wednesday", where
there are two instances of the "play soccer" event. In the vast
majority of cases, there is only one instance and the value in the
last column is "1". The file "event-attributes.tab" contains two more
columns: an attribute name and an attribute value.</p>

<!--
<p>In addition to "event-extents.tab", there is a file named
"main-events.tab" which contains the extents of main events. Each main
event is also an event, but the mainevent tag is a separate tag with a
separate id.</p>
-->

<p>Timexes and their attributes are stored in "timex-extents.tab" and
"timex-attributes.tab".</p>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	14	timex3	t2	1
wsj_0037	27	15	timex3	t2	1
</pre>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	27	14	timex3	t2	1	type	DURATION
wsj_0037	27	14	timex3	t2	1	value	P1Y
</pre>

<p>These files use the same colomns as their eventive counter
parts. But note that the attributes are associated with the first
token of the timex extent. Also note that the instance number is
always "1" for timexes.</p>

<p>The four classes of Tempeval temporal relations are all stored with
the same format. The associations between task indentifer and file
name are in the table below.</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr>
  <td>Task C</td>
  <td>tlinks-event-timex.tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Task D</td>
  <td>tlinks-dct-events.tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Task E</td>
  <td>tlinks-main-events.tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Task F</td>
  <td>tlinks-subordinated-events.tab</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The vertical files for the temporal relations all have four
columns: (1) filename, (2) tag id of the first element in the
relation, (3) tag id of the second element in the relation, and (4)
the relation type.  Here is a fragment of "tlinks-event-time.tab",
with the temporal relation between "host" and "a year".</p>

<pre class="example">
wsj_0037	e561	t2	overlap
</pre>

<p>For Task D ("tlnks-dct-events.tab"), the third column is always
"t0", where "t0" is a special id that refers to the Document Creation
Time. Note that the exact value of the DCT is not specified in the
file with timexes since it is not nexessarily associated with an
offset, instead, the DCT timex is given for each file in a separate
file named "dct.tab".</p>

<!--
<p>For task E ("tlinks-main-events.tab"), all the tag ids refer to the
ids in the "main-events.tab" file.</p>
-->

<a name="annotation"></a>
<h3>Annotation process</h3>

<p>Annotation of the trial data proceeded in several phases:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dual annotation of event extents</li>
<li>Judgement of event extents</li>
<li>Dual annotation of timex extents</li>
<li>Judgement of timex extents</li>
<li>Annotation of event and timex attributes</li>
<li>Annotation of temporal links</li>
</ol>

<p>The output of phases 2 and 4 was input to phases 5 and 6. Note that
for the trial data, no dual annotation was attempted. This will be
different for the training and evaluation data.</p>

<p>Annotators were given four documents to guide them in their tasks:
<a href="guidelines/introToTimeML-052809.pdf">TimeML overview</a>,
<a href="guidelines/EventGuidelines-050409.pdf">event annotation guidelines</a>,
<a href="guidelines/timex3guidelines-072009.pdf">timex annotation guidelines</a>, and
<a href="guidelines/tlink-guidelines-081409.pdf">TLINK annotation guidelines</a>. The
annotators were also asked to refer to additional descriptions of the ISO
format for timex values given in the <a
href="http://timeml.org/site/terqas/readings/MTRAnnotationGuide_v1_02.pdf">TIDES
Temporal Annotation Guidelines Version 1.0.2 document</a>.

<h3>Training and evaluation data</h3>

<p>The English training data will be different in at least the
following respects:</p>

<ol>

<li>Size. The training corpus will be an order of magnitude larger.

<li>Document selection. The documents in the trial data are very
large compared to most documents expected to be in the training
data. In addition, the first document in the trial set is a book
description, these kinds of documents will be excluded from the
training data.

<li>Annotation quality. The trial data have not been checked
rigurously and annotation guidelines were written while the annotation
was in progress. For the training data, we use fixed guidelines and
dual annotation.

<li>Temporal relations. The set of temporal relations may be changed
for some tasks.

<li>Eliminating little glitches. For example, not all events and
timexes have attributes due to a hickup in the annotation
procedure. This will be fixed for the training data.

</ol>

<p>The evaluation data will be held out from the entire corpus, but
otherwise be identical in format to the training data. However,
depending on the task some data will be left out:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr valign="top">
  <td>Tasks A and B</td>
  <td>Only the file "base-segmentation.tab" will be provided. The task
  would be to create the files "timex-extents.tab",
  "timex-attributes.tab", "event-extents.tab", and
  "event-attributes.tab".</td> 
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td>Tasks&nbsp;C&nbsp;through&nbsp;F</td>
  <td>All files will be provided, but the relation types in the files
  with temporal links will be set to "NONE". The task here is to
  replace "NONE" with one of the acceptable relation types.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Scorer scripts will be made available with the training data.</p>
