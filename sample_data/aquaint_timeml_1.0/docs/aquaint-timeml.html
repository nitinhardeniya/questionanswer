The annotation follows the TimeML1.2.1 specifications. This file includes a brief discussion of TimeMLas well as a description of how the AQUAINT TimeML Corpus was created.</p><p>The most recent information on TimeML is always availableat <a href="http://www.timeml.org">www.timeml.org.</a></p><p><a name="timeml"></a></p><h2>Overview of TimeML</h2><p>TimeML aims to capture and represent temporal information.  This isaccomplished using four primary tag types: TIMEX3 for temporalexpressions, EVENT for temporal events, SIGNAL for temporal signals,and LINK for representing relationships.  For a detailed descriptionof TimeML, see the TimeML 1.2.1 Specification and Guidelines, available at <a href="http://timeml.org/site/publications/specs.html">http://timeml.org/site/publications/specs.html</a>.Here, we giveasummary of the most important tags.</p><p><b>TIMEX3</b> &#8212; This tag is used to capture dates, times,durations, and sets of dates and times.  All TIMEX3 tags include atype and a value along with some other possible attributes. The valueis given according to the ISO 8601 standard. The TIMEX3 tag allowsspecification of a temporal anchor. This facilitates the use oftemporal functions to calculate the value of an under specifiedtemporal expression.  For example, an article might include a documentcreation time such as "January 3, 2006".  Later in the article, thetemporal expression "today" may occur.  By anchoring the TIMEX3 for"today" to the document creation time, we can determine the exactvalue of the TIMEX3.</p><p><b>EVENT</b> &#8212; The EVENT tag is used to annotate thoseelements in a text that mark the semantic events described by it. Anyevent that can be temporally anchored or ordered is captured with thistag.  An EVENT includes a class attribute with values suchas <val>occurrence</val>, <val>state</val>, or <val>reporting</val>.The class of an EVENT may indicate what relationships the eventparticipates in.  In addition to the EVENT tag, events are alsoannotated with one or more MAKEINSTANCE tags that include informationabout a particular instance of the event. This includes part ofspeech, tense, aspect, modality, and polarity. When an eventparticipates in a relationship, it is actually the event instance thatis referenced.  This is to allow for statements such as "John taughton Monday but not on Tuesday."  Here, there are actually two instancesof the teaching-event: one that has a positive polarity and one thatis negative.  Further, each instance participates in its own temporalrelationship with respect to "Monday" and "Tuesday".<p><b>SIGNAL</b> &#8212; The SIGNAL tag is used to annotate temporalfunction words such as "after", "during", and "when".  These signalsare then used in the representation of a temporal relationship.</p><p>The following three tags are link tags. They capture temporal,subordination, and aspectual relationships found in the text. Thesetags do not consume any actual text, but they do relate the threetag types above to each other.</p><p><b>TLINK</b> &#8212; Temporal links are represented with a TLINKtag.  A TLINK can temporally relate two temporal expressions, twoevent instances, or a temporal expression and an event instance.Along with an identification marker for each of these two elements, arelation type is given such as <val>before</val>, <val>includes</val>,or <val>ended_by</val>.  When a signal is present that helps to definethe relationship, an ID for the SIGNAL is given as well.</p><p><b>SLINK</b> &#8212; This tag is used to capture subordinationrelationships that involve event modality, evidentiality, andfactuality.  An SLINK includes an event instance ID for thesubordinating event and an event instance ID for the subordinatedevent.  Possible relation types for SLINKinclude <val>modal</val>, <val>evidential</val>,and <val>factive</val>.  An SLINK will typically not include a signalID unless it has the relation type conditional.  Three specific EVENTclasses interact with SLINK:<val>reporting</val>, <val>i_state</val>, and <val>i_action</val>.</p><p><b>ALINK</b> &#8212; An aspectual connection between two eventinstances is represented with ALINK.  As with SLINK, this tag includestwo event instance IDs, one that introduces the ALINK and one that isthe event argument to that event. The introducing event has theclass <val>aspectual</val>. Some possible relation types for ALINK are<val>initiates</val>, <val>terminates</val>,and <val>continues</val>.</p><p><a name="stats"></a></p><h2>Sources and Statistics</h2><p>The AQUAINT TimeML corpus contains 73 articles from a variety of news reports.  These particular sources were chosen because they offered text rich with temporal  information both in the form of temporal expressions and events that couldbe anchored or ordered in time. The documents were taken from four topics from  the TREC novelty track (see <a href="http://trec.nist.gov/tracks.html">http://trec.nist.gov/tracks.html</a>):</p><blockquote><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">  <tr>    <td>N16</td>    <td>Kenya Tanzania Embassy bombings</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>N19</td>    <td>Elian Gonzalez Cuba</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>N35</td>    <td>NATO, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>N45</td>    <td>Slepian abortion murder</td>  </tr></table></blockquote><p>The corpus contains about 35,000 tokens and some 16,000 tags were added (12,000  if we adjust for the redundancy introduced by the EVENT and MAKEINSTANCE tags).  Some annotation statistics are printed in the table below: </p><blockquote><table cellpadding="3pt"><tr>  <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td align="right">N16</td>  <td align="right">N19</td>  <td align="right">N35</td>  <td align="right">N45</td>  <td align="right">total</td></tr><tr>  <td colspan="6"><hr/></td>  </tr><tr>  <td>EVENT</td>  <td align="right" width="100">765</td>  <td align="right" width="100">2117</td>  <td align="right" width="100">490</td>  <td align="right" width="100">1060</td>  <td align="right" width="100">4432</td></tr><tr>  <td>MAKEINSTANCE</td>  <td align="right">765</td>  <td align="right">2117</td>  <td align="right">490</td>  <td align="right">1060</td>  <td align="right">4432</td></tr><tr>  <td>TIMEX3</td>  <td align="right">115</td>  <td align="right">253</td>  <td align="right">83</td>  <td align="right">154</td>  <td align="right">605</td></tr><tr>  <td>SIGNAL</td>  <td align="right">33</td>  <td align="right">77</td>  <td align="right">62</td>  <td align="right">96</td>  <td align="right">268</td></tr><tr>  <td>ALINK</td>  <td align="right">11</td>  <td align="right">39</td>  <td align="right">13</td>  <td align="right">8</td>  <td align="right">71</td></tr><tr>  <td>SLINK</td>  <td align="right">96</td>  <td align="right">203</td>  <td align="right">117</td>  <td align="right">259</td>  <td align="right">675</td></tr><tr>  <td>TLINK</td>  <td align="right">1013</td>  <td align="right">2788</td>  <td align="right">516</td>  <td align="right">1048</td>  <td align="right">5365</td></tr><tr>  <td colspan="6"><hr/></td></tr><tr>  <td>Total tags</td>  <td align="right">2798</td>  <td align="right">7594</td>  <td align="right">1771</td>  <td align="right">3685</td>  <td align="right">15848</td></tr><tr>  <td>Total tokens</td>  <td align="right">7027</td>  <td align="right">16242</td>  <td align="right">3631</td>  <td align="right">7254</td>  <td align="right">34154</td></tr><tr>  <td>Documents</td>  <td align="right">23</td>  <td align="right">25</td>  <td align="right">10</td>  <td align="right">15</td>  <td align="right">73</td></tr><tr>  <td colspan="6"><hr/></td>  </tr></table></blockquote><p>The data in N16, N19 and N45 contain only TimeML tags, the documents in N35  also contain document-level tags like DOCNO, HEADER, TEXT, and others.</p><p><a name="anno"></a></p><h2>Annotation Effort</h2><p>Each article was annotated by one of three experienced annotators from Brandeis  University or Georgetown University. All documents were then validated  against version 1.2.1 of the TimeML Document  TypeDefinition. Validity checking against the DTD was performed    using the Perl XML::Checker::Parser module, available as part of XML-Checker-0.13from <a href="http://www.cpan.org/" target="_blank">www.cpan.org</a>, usingthe <a href="../validation/validate.pl">validate.p</a><a href="aquaint_timebank/validate.pl">l</a> script.</p><p>It should be noted that although we validated all annotations, the AQUAINT  TimeML corpus is not as mature as TimeBank 1.2. More specifically, we did  not go through several rounds of annotation and annotation reviews. Also, neither  TimeBank 1.2 nor the AQUAINT TimeML corpus have used dual annotation.</p><p>Inter-annotator agreement scores were not  created for the AQUAINT TimeML  corpus. Refer to the TimeBank 1.2 <a href="http://timeml.org/site/timebank/documentation-1.2.html">documentation</a> for  the IAA scores for TimeBank 1.2.</p><p><a name="contrib"></a></p><h2>Contributors</h2><p>The following people  have contributed to the AQUAINT TimeML corpus:</p><blockquote>  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">    <tr>	  <td colspan="6"><hr/></td>	</tr>    <tr>      <td valign="top">Annotation</td>      <td> Jenna Fernandes, Jessica Moszkowicz,  Stephanie Poisson</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td valign="top">Validation</td>      <td>Seo-Hyun Im, Emin Mimaroglu, Jessica Moszkowicz, Hongyuan Qiu,       Marc Verhagen</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td valign="top">Other</td>      <td>James Pustejovsky, Inderjeet Mani, Roser Saur&iacute;, Amber Stubbs,      Marc Verhagen</td>    </tr>    <tr>	  <td colspan="6"><hr/></td>	</tr>  </table></blockquote><p>The AQUAINT TimeML corpus was created as part of the TARSQI  project which  was funded under the ARDA/DTO AQUAINT program under grant number NBCH040027.</p><p><a name="distribution"></a></p><h2>Contents of the Distribution</h2><p>aquaint_timeml_1.0/data/</p><blockquote> Contains the 73 annotated documents, grouped in four directories.</blockquote><p>aquaint_timeml_1.0/doc/</p><blockquote> This file plus the TimeML specifications and guidelines.</blockquote><p>aquaint_timeml_1.0/validation/</p><blockquote>Contains two versions of the DTD and the Perl script used for validation. </blockquote><p><a name="contact" id="contact"></a></p><h2>Contact</h2>Please contact us at timebank@timeml.org if you have any questions or remarks.<p></p><p><a name="copy"></a></p><h2>Copyright Notice</h2>      <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">      <img src="somerights20.png" alt="Creative Commons License"       width="88" height="31" border="0" style="border-width:0" /></a><br/> <p>The annotations in this data collection are copyrighted by BrandeisUniversity and are released under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">CreativeCommons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License</a>. </p><p>Note: The textual news documents annotated in this corpus have beencollected from a wide range of sources and are not copyrighted by Brandeis University.
