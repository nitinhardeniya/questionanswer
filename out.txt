<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P85Y">85-year-old</TIMEX3> Advani on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX3> skipped the BJP national executive, perhaps for the first time in the party's history, apparently to express his opposition to making Modi the campaign committee chief, which will in effect present him as the face of the party for the next general elections. 

Advani cited ill health as the reason for his staying away from the two-day conclave beginning <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="">today</TIMEX3>, party sources said. 

However, the sources said the party is keen to make the announcement about Modi at the national executive and the RSS has given its go-ahead to it. 

Meanwhile, BJP leaders tried to playdown Advani's absence at the national executive meet. 

Party general secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy said he had enquired about Advani's health and he is actually unwell. Insisting that not much should be read into this issue, he said Advani would have loved to be present at the conclave. 

BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said Advani is indisposed and hence, he has not been able to attend the meeting.
